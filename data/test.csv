I booked a large group here for my Wedding Rehearsal dinner. I wanted something that had a private-ish area for our group, but had character and good food!

We ended up booking an area downstairs with tall bar tables and stools. There were also other private dining rooms you can book out as well. When I was planning this, it was super easy. They have a $30 per person set menu that comes with an antipasto plate with appetizers and cured meats and cheeses. Then I could choose from their menu any pizza I wanted which they will determine the number that are made and come out based on 3-4 slices a person. 
It also includes dessert which they also determined on the day, but there was TONS of food and LOTS of leftovers. 
I could also pre-order wine which was a great suggestion as then with the group people could just state ""white"" or ""red"" and it was ready to go. You only pay for what you drink. 

The servers were friendly, and was really good at adjusting the price based on the number of people that did not show up. 
I loved that the resto was able to overall just make you pay for what you eat without over charging. 

I've never been to Libretto before, but love that they have unique pizza choices, all that were very good. My favourite was the Spicy Sausage pizza. (as opposed to the house made sausage). The Duck Confit was good too but didn't have enough taste for me. 
For apps, they gave us a bunch of food, but the most memorable was the Gnocchi and we couldn't stop eating it. 
For dessert, we got the infamous tiramisu which was amazing.

There is also an option for Spelt Crust!",3,0BBUmH7Krcax1RZgbH4fSA

I'm not a tea expert. I don't own a diffuser. I prefer my tea iced and plain because, frankly, I'm sweet enough. 

In search of the ever elusive 'thoughtful' Christmas gift for my picky sister I stopped in at Fleur de Teas in the hopes of finding something special. I wasn't disappointed. 

The shop, located next to the Phoenix City Grille, is small and cozy. Don't let the size fool you, this small spot is bursting at the seams with a huge variety of tea, tea accessories and beauty products. 

The staff was friendly and very helpful, walking me through several different varieties of tea until I found exactly what I was looking for. Needless to say, the gift was a hit (and very reasonably priced).

During this time it was a constant bill goes up every year and you have to call and fight your way down to where you were before. I got to the point where their ""loyalty dept"" could no longer work with me as I was an ""existing client"". I was told they could no longer offer me promotions. After 8 years really?? So I cancelled my service. After a month of homework on other company's I found out they have a monopoly in Las Vegas and pretty much are the only good internet company here. Basically we are in their hands.
I spoke to an IT friend and he recommended me buying my own modem and router, then going to just connect service. I went in and explained my situation. Savino was very nice and understanding of the hell I just went through with their company. Not only did he manage to reconnect my service, but gave me a way better deal then their stupid ""loyalty dept"". Please save yourself the headache of calling and come in to speak to these guys.

We booked a fountain view room at the Bellagio and we were not disappointed, the lady at check in asked if we had a preference for floor and we told her to give us the best in her opinion, so we were placed on the 28th floor. The elevators are a thrill ride, LOL ZOOOOM! We walked in the room and WOW! The Eiffel tower at the Paris and the entire fountain area like a postcard!
 Best room I have every had in Vegas. Comfy bed and pillows, very clean and fully stocked (but pricey) mini bar. LOL, But vending and ice was just up the hall. 
Casino was fun. better class of folks for the most part, but still a party atmosphere. Actually didnt do too bad and came home with winnings! 
WE do tip well, so we had some really good bell & valet service. Really not sure why anyone would complain, unless nothing pleases them. It was one of the best experiences I have had traveling, and the place is JUST GORGEOUS!! The flowers alone are worth the visit! 
The resort is not for folks who want to get stupid and loud, head to hard Rock if thats your thing. It does have that high end elegance that many casinos and hotels are missing in town.
Also if you LOVE high end shopping ( even if its just the window variety) you can spend a day inside and around the resort. its located in a fun spot on the strip. The money they didnt get at slots I spent at Giardini for beautiful Italian ceramics! Better than a cheap T-shirt, LOL.
Then there is Jean Phillipes Patisserie, with the giant chocolate fountain. Not just decadent sweets, but great Panini and crepes for lunch, and we made it our go to for coffee and Brioche for breakfast. Grab something and go sit by the pool with the paper ( Only for guests) .
Awesome dinner on your checklist? We chose Le Cirque at the Bellagio.  If French food is your thing,and you like to dress to impress, its one of the best. The service was amazing, the decor & the plates were wonderful and the food Gourmet. They helped me arrange a surprise for our anniversary and presented the table with a Beautiful cake from Jean Phillipes in our anniversary colors! 5 star+ to their whole team!!

1. The material and the offerings this brand has for Winter wear is of no match to any other brand and hence the price does all the justice. It comes with a 10 year warranty, what else would you need.
2. Such stores are always jam packed and its very difficult for any sales associate to handle multiple at the same time. Yes, even if you deploy a soldier of sales men, its not enough for such a store
3. What they offer is promising and  they do no compromise on quality or safety when it comes to winter wear.
4. The sales associate 'Luna' was super sweet to us. Though it was the peek of season and super busy, she was kind enough to answer every question and took time to explain every detail of the varieties they had at the store.

I happened upon this store while on a ""book quest"" during my stay in Phoenix in July 2013. I am a huge supporter of independently owned book stores, so I was really excited to find this gem. Though it's pretty small in comparison to some of the other indie shops I've been too, this book store has a pretty awesome selection of books. 

All the sections and shelves are well organized so books are easy to find. At the register, there is a glass showcase that holds some first editions, and even some autographed copies as well. 

The owner was very friendly, and extremely helpful. They were running some awesome specials as well. There are several tables at the front of the store where any of the books you find or select are only $2 each. I got several hardcover books (used) in EXCELLENT condition for $2 each. There are a few new books scattered throughout as well, but this store specializes in USED. IF you go to the back of the store, you'll find ""Dollar Mountain"", which is a HUGE stack of books that are all $1. Awesome deal!

So, when I was in this store, I asked the owner: ""What happens to the hundreds of books you get in that don't sell? Do you toss them? Recycle them?"" His reply: ""Some I do send off to be recycled into new paper for new books, but I primarily donate them to the troops overseas in Afghanistan and Iraq.""--That answer alone inspired me to make a hefty purchase. We need more stores and people like this to stay in business. These businesses are great for the community.

E7wlbsQgh4S38ESTSdMe-Q,1,2014-06-24,1,ogmQFgCfqkVQo_iFIaILOw,0.0,"I discovered Las Vegas ATV Tours via Groupon and read some of the mixed (but mostly good) review via Trip Advisor and Yelp.  Overall, it seemed like everyone was super happy with their tour.

Communication is a little spotty at times, but mainly because it's a mom and pop kind of business and everyone works in that joint.  After a tour is when these guys respond to your emails and phone calls.  

We signed up for the One Hour Tour.  John picked us up from The Four Seasons Hotel along with other folks from different hotels on the strip and we headed towards the Motor Speedway where they dropped us off next to the Airforce base.  It's about a 30 mins drive. To begin with, I have never driven an ATV before, but I owned a scooter for seven years and have driven a motorcycle, so I am well aware of how to dress on a moving vehicle.  However, a few of the gals did not.  

Girls - be smart, not stupid.  Wear pants and choose the morning session in the summer.  It's simply too hot to do this tour in the middle of the afternoon.  You'll die.  Second, wear moisture wicking clothes as you will sweat and pour water all over your body.  Bring a light long sleeved shirt.  The sun is strong and no matter how much sunscreen you apply, you'll be thankful for the coverage when the wind picks up and sand is blowing onto your bare arms.  Second, wear old tennis shoes. Not TOMS, not Keds, not sandals.  Again, don't be an idiot, you are in the desert on a 4-wheeler.  The pedals have metal prongs and you need protection from the heat of the engine.

Last, bring a small backpack filled with water, extra sunscreen, ibuprofen, kleenex (i.e. toilet paper), chapstick and a bandana.  While the group gives you a water during the half time break, they only bring enough water for one bottle per person.  It's hot outside and the heat definitely got to me.  I wish I would have brought extra water and a bandana to cover my mouth from all the dirt.

Now, onto the tour.  I thought it was amazing.  The guys are tatted up, smoke and good ole' boys - they know what they are doing.  They did a great job describing what we would be doing and the hand signals to follow.  They also had extra riders to round up the caboose and let the girls ride tandem in the event they were too scared to drive an ATV.  They warm you up with an easy start filled with small bumps and hills.  As you become more comfortable with the ATV,  you  have the option to be more aggressive as you trust the machine over time.  They definitely make it clear to do whatever you feel most comfortable with and they never make you feel stupid for taking it slow and careful.  They know the area like the back of their dry, tan hands and do their job well.

Honestly, a one hour would have sufficed for me, as it's hot and physically exhausting, but we winded up riding two hours.  I'm not complaining, it was great fun, but for a retreat recreation I am planning in September, I would recommend to my older clients to perhaps consider just an hour as it is very physically demanding.  Also, your gas is in what looks like a gear shift on your right handle bar, it's a lot of strain to your right hand - it doesn't work like a motorcycle.  So be prepared for some terrible texting, post tour.

I winded up flying over a ""Witch's Eye"" and into a dune, causing me to almost flip over the handlebars.  I didn't, but winded up jamming my right thigh into the throttle and right handlebar.  It left a nasty bruise, cut and whiplash, but it was all worth it.  The staff was great - they made sure I was OK, gave me water and asked several times if I wanted to stop and go back.  I assured them I was OK, and while I definitely felt it the next day...and today...I am still so happy I did the tour.  It was great to get out into the desert, out of the strip, see the jets fly above you and meet some new people. I definitely would recommend this group and Casey as your guide.  To make this trip more enjoyable - be prepared, not a dumb-ass.

Lunch is provided afterwards and the team is eager to take group photos.  If you are ever in Vegas and looking for something different to do, give them a a call and go in the morning!",2,TeDtY8Bq48fiIhXhPk2fIw

The very BIG ""medium"" cone dipped in chocolate that I got almost brought tears to my eyes. Not simply because it was creamy, delicious, melty and amazing but because it reminded me of my childhood. When I was a kid (I grew up in Russia), we went to Moscow and got a chocolate covered ice cream bar. It was almost identical taste to the soft serve cone dipped in chocolate that I got at Tom's. 

Beware: the ice cream (perhaps because it's real cream and not modified milk ingredient slush) melts REALLY fast. The chocolate was almost falling off my cone. It was so worth it though. I got twist flavour but next time I am going for vanilla alone for the purity of it.

Also, their sizes are generous. A medium really is a large. I've seen people with a large and it is HUGE. I recommend starting off with a small unless you're really sure you want a LOT of soft serve.

I would highly recommend Tom's to anyone who's looking for either good soft serve or good old fashioned ice cream in general.",1,3fvKDeCHJQgl-wY5ykpNKg

The owner is an importer of home decor goods primarily from Turkey, Iran and India.  
In addition to the lamps there are brightly colored hand-painted ceramics like bowls and platters which we were were told are done in traditional Ottoman Empire designs.

There are inlaid and carved pieces of furniture and some beautiful carpets.  
If I were to build a Riyad-style Moroccan house, this is where I'd come to accessorize it.

Toward the front of the store I spotted several jewelry cases.  What caught my attention in particular were the pieces of evil eye jewelry.  There were pendants, bracelets, earrings, sun-catchers; evil eye repellers all.

There are many cultures that believe in the necessity of warding off the evil eye.  I come from two of those cultures and I grew up on stories about the ""malocchio"". It wasn't unusual to see someone wearing a gold horn (cornuto) necklace. 

In this shop I purchased the Turkish version of an Evil Eye pendant which is in the shape of an eye.  It's made in Swarovski crystal mosaic.  What I'd tell you if you'd ask, is that I love the way it looks.    But what I'd also like to believe is that it might be giving me a little extra protection to get through the day.

I sampled a little bit of everything just about since we were all doing a communal snacking type deal and I think the only thing that was even borderline decent was the mini chicken tenders. The nachos had some kind of cheese whiz type sauce which tasted like it was from a jar. I think they brought us 6 or so mozzarella sticks and at least two of them didn't even have any cheese in them. The fried pickles were the soggiest incarnation I've ever tasted and the both the pizza and chicken sandwich were greasy. Overall it was just a crummy meal.

The place appears to serve desserts, coffee, and wine (not sandwiches/bread).  They don't open very early (11:00 am) and stay open up into the evening.  It would be a nice place for a casual date, conversation with friends, or an after movie/theatre/church snack. The owners might have come up with a nice niche for their business and hopefully it works because the desserts appear awesome.

The  service was very friendly and the pastry I  had (chocolate brownie/chocolate chip cookie) were really yummy.  The pastry looked like super quality stuff and from what I saw prices ranged from about $3 for cookies/brownies to $4 for very unique macarons to about $7 for very high-end cake desserts.  The more pricey desserts looked big enough to share with a date, spouse, or significant other.

The shop has about ten tables and is nicely decorated and clean.  It has a classy-artsy-bistro feel but is mellow with cool music.  It's tucked away in the corner of a strip mall at 215 and Stephanie, but it is not hard to find.",1,apXG1chGeeH9jDVmRBwSIw

I was a bit disappointed by the manicure and pedicure facilities. There are quite a few stations (almost too many for the room) which feel kind of squished together. The chairs aren't particularly comfy - there are no massage armchairs here. The room was also quite noisy and difficult to relax in. The quality of both my manicure and pedicure wasn't quite as good as I was expecting for a spa. Considering Elmwood charges significantly more than Nailsense, which I usually visit to get my nails done, I wasn't blown away.

Your body is your temple and all that, but it's also a machine, and if the pulleys and levers are out of place/sync/whack, then no amount of epsom salt and meditation is going to cure what ails ya. Just like how you gotta work out to get stronger, you gotta work on your injuries to make them better.

I spend a very large portion of my life either rock climbing or hiking somewhere to film someone else rock climbing. The rest of my life is spent behind a computer, seated, in what is possibly the most unhealthy bodily configuration for someone with chronically tight forearms, upper arms, chest, and back. Add to that some chronic elbow tendonitis (or -osis, whatever), a hectic schedule living on the road, and you have a recipe for a bundle of chronic pain and limited mobility.

I keep most of this crap at bay with self-therapy, but that only goes so far. It feels like vacuuming the kitchen floor, when really, it needs a mop.

Scott is that mop.

People like Biaggio are the precise reason why we need to support our local businesses. Great food. Personal service. Owners who aren't happy until you're happy.

It was New Year's Day and my friend and I were looking for a place to watch the Rose Bowl. I called Biaggio's to make sure they'd be open and he said they'd switch the channel to whatever we wanted to watch.

When we got there, Biaggio somehow recognized me from Yelp. He knew I was the one who ended up backing out of the CMYE. Wow! For someone who claims to not be all that internet-savvy, he sure does keep a finger on the pulse of social media.

Long story short, my friend ordered an Italian Stromboli and I had a Pastrami Stromboli. We didn't realize how huge they would be, so we added some Garlic Knots for good measure. The Garlic Knots were extremely moist and doughy on the inside. And they're huge! But nowhere near as huge as the Strombolis. Even with a 3-hour game, there was no way we'd be able to eat all that food. Oh and yes, the Strombolis were all they were hyped up to be. I personally like the Pastrami over the Italian and my friend concurs. So delicious.

With our Strombolis only half eaten, the food coma was setting in and we decided to leave at half time. Biaggio stops us and says we have some Fried Dough on the way. Um. OK. How can you turn down free food from such a generous man? Of course, the Fried Dough was awesome. It's basically pizza dough topped with butter, cinnamon, and powdered sugar. It smelled really sweet, but it was surprisingly mellow. We had a few pieces and added the rest to our to-go boxes.

It goes without saying that I'll be coming back. I need to try the Chicken Wings that everyone is raving about. Also, when I mentioned that my boss loves pastrami, he offered to send us a Pastrami Stromboli when I return to work on Monday. Now that is the epitome of generosity!

The Argus has been around for over two decades, and has changed relatively little in that time.  It's vibe can change dramatically, depending on the time of day, type of demographic inside, and other factors which are less predictable.  Think of it as the bar version of that person you used to date who had many mercurial moods, but always wore the same clothes.  Lunch may be the most benign time there, when laconic patrons and downtown employees take advantage of the wide variation of menu and drink choices.  What to order off the menu could occupy a review in itself, but suffice it to say that there are rewards and choices which are problematic.  On a recent visit, I was a little short of cash and thought a humble burger would be a good compromise at $5.75.  While a 1/3 lb. patty is the standard offering, and lettuce, tomato and slivers of red onion, along with condiments are served without additional charge, the final result is about as inspired as retired CPA.  Other more successful offerings include their Reuben, different salads, wraps, and decent chicken sandwiches.  Drink menu is complete and the pours are healthy.  For proof, just check the clientele at closing time on the weekends, when the place becomes a loud and unapologetic hot mess for young people to either celebrate their tinder conquests or just get hammered like a good Wisconsin citizen.

Tried the lasagne. Not doing that again! Close to 10 bucks with tax I got a bowl with a lump of pasta literally swimming in sauce, I mean it floated! I told the guy I didn't order chili and he just shrugged and pointed to some parmesian sprinkle cheese, as if that would make it authentic. I almost spilled the sauce as I walked to my table asit slopped from side to side. Topping it off; a 2x2 piece of bread with a hardened butter packet. You'd think with all those lovely Italian rolls for the beef, they could spare a little more than the butt. It then dawned on me, this is what they cut off before making their signature Italian beef. Pity! I'd suggest sticking with the signature instead of scribbling something and calling it lasagne. Don't waste your $$$.

The decor is chic and comfortable, but not pretentious in any way. It attracts an eclectic clientele, with a wide range of ages. The music is present, and reasonably loud, but not so you have to shout, or even pay much attention to it (I really can't remember what was playing). It's the sort of place you can dress up to go, but at the same time, you won't feel under-dressed in jeans. (I wouldn't go in sports clothes though.) My only concern was that it is a tad on the dark side, which makes it difficult to read the tiny-printed menu when you're over 40... 

The tapas-style food offerings are top quality. I tried the gravlax, the beet and feta salad, (served together), the charcuterie platter, and the beans in truffle oil, (also served together, which made for great marriages). There was plenty for two.

I had a yen for pinot noir, but was struggling with the very long wine list. The servers are billed as sommeliers, and definitely seem to know their wines. Ours suggested one I'd been hesitating over, but it turned out to be unavailable. She offered an excellent substitute at an even better price, so we ended up having two bottles! :-)

I don't know why it took me so long to get here. I think I feared it would be pretentious and disappointing, but honestly I found it exactly the sort of place I've been looking for for a while.",2,WYU7YDh9u7tr__XGRwj3ZQ

The views and setting are beautiful. The facility is nice and clean. I keep trying it but still get the same results.

I think my biggest problem is the menu. I am not sure they know quite what they are going for. Are they catering for the tastes of the local trilogy patrons? Kind of, but then they try to fancy it up and make it super gourmet but it doesn't work. The food is like the girl at the party who just tries too hard. She seems like she has everything right, but there is just something off about her, especially when you look at her closely. The food all sounds really good on the menu, but when it comes out it is just heavy. They seem to rely more on the use of heavy creams and butters to try and make the dish taste good instead of seasonings. I cannot find anything on the menu that I like. I tried the salmon- it was very dry. They do not have a wide selection of salads  that appeal to me either.  The Caesar is just ok. I did not like the asian salad. My dad loves the wedge salad though. I also did not like the flavor of the french onion soup.  My husband always gets the macaroni and cheese. It is good, but again very heavy and he always gets a stomach ache. I do eat a little seafood, but there are no vegetarian options under the entre section. 

We also came here for cinco de mao. It adverstised an all you can eat mexican buffet. It was pretty terrible. The churros were rock hard and inedible. The rest of the food was mediocre and limited. 

We did come for Easter brunch and it was excellent. I would do that again in a heartbeat. That was the only time i have been truly happy here. 

I guess the menu just needs to be revamped to include lighter, healthier, more organic fair if they want to charge the higher prices. 

Also, they have live music a lot on the patios and leave the doors open. I know a lot of people there are hard of hearing, and they cannot have a conversation because the music is so loud.",5,cCtB72I6FfLDcU7Zk67N9g

We just knew we were going to wait until 3pm to check in, since we arrived at 11 a.m., so in this sense we were prepared, but Mandalay made sure we were settled in by 11:15!

We ate at the buffet (not my first choice anywhere), and again were pleasantly surprised from the decor of the hotel, to the choice of food selection, not your everyday buffet.

I was very lucky that one of the workers came into my work and we got onto the topic of the business she works for and was super sweet to give me some passes to try them out. 

A few months later I decided to give it a try and was very happy I did. When I got inside I filled out paperwork and we got started on a consultation. The manager, Mariana, was nothing but amazing with me the whole time talking me through every step. She directed me first to the ""Hydration System"" where it steams your body for about 20 minutes. Prior to that I bought into a Stretch Mark cream to put on before, that way when the steam is opening my pores, the cream can insert and help treat my recent marks. First impression would be relaxing. After the 20 minutes, your body feels very hydrated therefore it was worth it!

Then we moved over to the Red Light Therapy where the light helps with the overall health of your skin. It penetrates and helps with fine lines, wrinkles, stretch marks, and even collagen. Although I haven't seen very much of a result quite yet, I do believe her when she says it would take multiple sessions to really improve your overall skin. 

Next I had an automated massage which was all deep tissue and at the same time was having another light therapy on my face and neck. She had me apply a cream (for my acne, which I chose) and it the light helped the cream soak into my skin. Now the day I went in, I came in with no makeup, overall redness, large pores, and tons of acne on my chin. When I woke up the next day, I noticed more than half of that was gone. I was amazed because the cream and light therapy really did improve my face a ton and I would definitely be back to do that one again. 

At the very end, we decided it would be a good idea to try a spray tan (for the first time) because the hydration station helped hydrate my skin and with that, if your skin was dry, the color wouldn't absorb properly and you would probably result patchy. It evenly distributed all over my body and next time might want to go a shade darker now that I know what to expect. 

Overall experience, Mariana was amazing and very easy to talk to through the process and I was really excited she was there to help me out and makes sure I was comfortable. I'll be back!",0,TKVjiIAbmBtotNgD-I2m_Q

CWO8uizKGwTzZnLZGQCnGQ,7,2016-12-23,5,JB7bnppWqpehZR82iJYeSQ,0.0,"What brought me to Fones Gone Wild was that my Galaxy S5 fone had gone wild. Nearing the end of its life, it was more frequently a dark screen when I pressed the power button. This was not cool. I had visited a few shops to inquire about the problem in addition to a factory reset. When I looked up smartphone repair shops on Yelp, the high rating was encouraging. After work I headed to Fones Gone Wild with the expectation that a tech genius could bring my ailing Galaxy S5 back to life. 

   Contrary to the highly rated reviews I have a mixed opinion of Fones Gone Wild. It is a good and bad opinion. The following two paragraphs discuss the good that summarizes the first half of the visit and the bad that summarizes the second half. 

The good:

    After walking into the small shop that is across from UNLV and near Einstein Bagels, I walked passed the display of refurbished phones to where the room dead ended at the service counter. There an older man asked how he can help me. I was a different customer from the majority that walk through the door to replace a screen. The tech genius that I was hoping to bring life back to my phone executed a factory reset on my phone. He carefully opened the Otter Box then displaced the SIM and SD cards. He emphasized if I had everything saved. This was an extraordinary long factory reset. As the Galaxy S5 was erasing everything at a speed slower than molasses, he would gently wipe down the screen. He stated that a factory reset doesn't usually take this long. When the Galaxy S5 finally erased everything, things turned bad. 

The Bad:

   You gotta love technology (sarcastic). As soon as the phone booted up it demanded my Samsung password. The problem is that I had been signing into Google to sign onto the smartphone. Every attempt I made to get into the phone was futile. Now the older man went onto other things. I appreciate the time that he took to reset my phone. Now a younger guy was at the counter. I pressed him on what to do to get into the sign in. He said that there was a way around this where he could get me into my Samsung account. It would cost $65. Talk about being between a rock and a hard place. I work very hard for my money and $65 was a lot of money to get me into my Samsung account. By now he was enthusiastically helping the uptenth customer who walked in the door for a screen repair. I knew of a way to get around the Samsung password block at zero cost. After he placed my SIM card and SD card back into my unresponsive Galaxy S5 that was seriously loosing battery life in the process of a factory reboot, I drove up the street to the Clark County Public Library to use the computer. For the equivalent of the $65 that Fones Gone Wild was going to charge me all I did was go to the Samsung account website where I typed in a couple of personal items and tadah I passed the Samsung sign in. It was so obvious that Fones Gone Wild could of imputed this information on their computer or had let me do it. 

Possibility of a return visit:

  In conclusion when I get my next smartphone, I plan to pay additional for insurance. When the smartphone breaks, I will have the peace of mind that there is a replacement. There is no reason for me to return here.",10,0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w

Went in yesterday for lunch and there was a small line and the place was fairly packed so I figure the food at least must be decent. Went through and ordered and paid for our food and grabbed one of the cleaner tables. The condiment containers are all pretty gross. I understand when a place is busy you can't necessarily get everything as sparkling as it maybe should be but the ketchup was dried and caked onto the bottle, that doesn't happen in a short while. Cleanliness aside, our server was pleasant and the food was pretty good. It wasn't the greatest burger and fries I've ever had but it was worth going back for. 

That said, the management/owners seem to treat their staff poorly. I watched several interactions with the servers that made me think this place runs like a prison. Asking for a to-go box became a problem for our server because apparently she had the audacity to give me one of the larger boxes instead of a smaller one. I've never seen so many people chastised for whatever they did wrong, out in the open during a rush. Seeing that turned me off pretty fast and you can see how their behavior changes the demeanor of the servers. Not sure if I'll be back but I doubt it.

We decided to dine in and quickly grabbed a table because they were almost full. There is tons of interesting decore that reminded me that I was in a antique shop. We sat near the bathroom that is right by the front ordering counter. There is package station for leftovers which was helpful because they were busy with customers the whole time we were there. There is also hot sauce and ketchup bottles at the station, a few arcade games and a flat screen tv in the back, and a few trivia card games on a few of the tables.

The food came out to our table quickly. The wings were plump and flavorful. Finally, we found some wings that didn't skimp on the meat. The wings came with sides of ranch and carrot sticks. The burgers were awesome. The French fries were soooo tasty. I love this place and will be returning in the future.

BTW, if I can just digress for a moment...I see things at the club that no person should ever be subjected to...this particular morning was no different...an 85 year old, Grandpa Jones look alike, standing naked at one of the sinks, one leg up on the counter and shaving ""himself"" in places that I had trouble believing that anyone other him would care about...you just can't ""un-see"" that kind of thing:(

If that describes you...please, for the love of god...go into a shower stall or something...I was blinded from seeing this and I spent the next twenty minutes stumbling along, asking for someone to just put me out of my misery, before I managed to grope my way into a shower and boil myself:)

Anyway...I still needed a haircut...(or, I needed to reform my band from 1970...we played a very ragged version of ""House of the Rising Sun""...and that's about all we played:)

These days, my choice for sartorial reconstruction is V's Barber Shop...I used to go to Great Clips, but V's  has won me back and won me back for good:)

This location is everything I want in a great barber shop...a manly experience that simply cannot be duplicated at a ""salon"":)

Nowhere near enough testosterone in any salon...even the unisex Super Clips and Great Cut's:)

That's not the case at V's...it's all testosterone, all the time:)

The barbers are all barbers...they may be stylists too, but first and foremost, they are barbers...they know how to cut hair for men and they know how to chat with guys like the great barbers I used to frequent in San Francisco and Portland.

Lots of sports to talk about (and flat panel TV's with ESPN on at every station), plenty of magazines to read while I'm waiting for my call to action (and not a Cosmo or Vogue in sight:) and tons of wood paneling and manly smells (I mean witch hazel, talcum powder, etc....not ""pull my finger"" manly smells:)

And, most importantly, they cut my hair correctly...all of the barbers and any of the barbers at V's do a good job...they cut my hair right...as right as my poor misshapen head will allow:)

That's important to me, because (as I might have mentioned before), I'm not a ""classically handsome"" man...I'm a little bit ""quirky looking""...and a decent haircut helps:)

I'm pretty sure that a good haircut is the only thing that keeps the Beautiful Carin from second guessing herself and the (possibly drunken) decision making that led her to select me as her husband (no one ever believes that she proposed to me...I can't believe it myself...but that was a great haircut that I was sporting that day! :-)

So I'm back at V's and I'm happy to swing by and get my ""ears lowered"" (a colloquialism that I suppose is lost in the mists of time) and talk football and golf and chicks and other guy stuff with my buddies at V's:)

And if you need one, there are even post or pre-haircut cocktails available next door at the Arcadia Tavern...and believe me, sometimes quite a bit of alcohol is required to forget the horrors I've seen in the locker room at the Village:)

Waffles soggy on the bottom (from sucking some kind of liquid) and dried out on top. etc. etc.

Bottom line: if you go there, stick to drinks ... although they also managed to serve lemonade without ice (so lukewarm). They just don't bother putting any kind of effort with the food, probably because they know they will get customers regardless because of the patio and location alone.

Amazing fresh, seasoned crinkle-cut fries. I mean, they're crinkle-cut fries, but try them. Seriously. I've never had Mac's fries, but I doubt they get much better than this.

Lightly battered yet crispy and flavorful fried pickles (edged out Mac's for my number 1 fried pickle, which was not an easy decision!)

Fried corn-good, but with the French fries and fried pickles, I probably would have enjoyed this corn freshly steamed/grilled better. Add salt-it makes it yummier. 

Macaroni and cheese. Not bad, uses more of a cheese sauce than melty/crusty/baked cheese. I prefer the latter, and depending on the day (i.e. Mac's isn't skimping on the cheese), Mac's has them beat.

The collard greens were sweet and yummy, but I felt like the serving was a little small. Mac's has a little more spice and tang to the sweetness, adding depth of flavor, but I did enjoy them and would order them again.

The baked beans were just okay to me. They had a little extra BBQ or smoked flavor, but they didn't stand out to me. I happen to love Mac's baked beans so the bar was very high, but I'd probably give them a 5/10, whereas Mac's gets a 10 out of 10 for me.

My son got the beef brisket the first time we went, but it was pretty fatty and from my perspective Mac's has amazing brisket. I got turkey the last time I went and it was okay, a little dry. The BBQ sauce was good though, which made up for it, almost.

Overall Sauceman's will be added to our list of BBQ choices, but probably only when I'm craving their fries and pickles.",0,jgLA8HnJOlpR6PQ_VldaeQ

Although we love Italian food, we normally don't eat it out, preferring to try food we don't cook so much at home. 
What a delight Osteria Costa is! Firstly, all the staff were extremely attentive and friendly - we didn't wait more than 30 seconds before we had water and menus. Jen, our lovely waitress brought us some delicious (although a little expensive ) wine selections & explained the menu to us.
We decided to share appetizer, salad, entree & dessert 'family style'.

We decided to make the trek out because of the free breakfast entree coupon. The yelp reviews looked great, so we decided to head to Egg Works instead of a typical Sunday brunch on the strip. Whenever we woke up that Sunday morning, we packed and stumbled to the car to get some breakfast. After about a 20 minute drive from the strip, we finally arrived at Egg works. 

The place is relatively big, so the wait for 3 wasn't about 15 minutes. After being seated, we were promptly served drinks and then was left to look over the extensive menu. I decided on a side order of the corned beef hash and the Green Chili omelet. The omelet was extremely large. It probably had 3 whole Ortega chilies, a ton of cheese, and another ton of cheese on top. The omelet was good, but nothing special. Along with the omelet came a side of home potatoes that seemed like it was tossed with a whole bottle of Lawry's season salt. If you like that stuff, then you'll love these potatoes. If not, I'd see if they can cut the season salt next time. The corned beef and hash was interesting. It was more like corned beef and mashed potato pancake that was crisped on the flat top.

I was out milling about on Mill Ave, and while we were trying to find our next stop, we walked by the open door and empty bar. The guy at the door was enticing us with $4 Long Islands and $2 shots. I can see why....no one wants to come in here. It's lame.

You see, back when it was The Library, this place had attractive bartenders dressed as....librarians (skirts and all). A magical place, where you could have a great time. Then it started getting played out, and eventually closed.

Now, it's Blondies....it's just a run of the mill (get it?) bar with average drinks, a great location, no TV's, turrible music and a pathetic crowd. There's no theme, it's disgusting, and the ghetto crowd in the back playing Beer Pong was lame.

They didn't even have red/blue party cups. They were using cheap plastic tumblers for Beer Pong. Isn't that illegal?

I've been complaining for a while, so you are probably thinking, ""Dave, why didn't you just leave?"" The night was winding down, we were kind of tired, and we just wanted to chill. Afterall, there were plenty of places to sit, since hardly anyone was in here.

Although the flavors change regularly, I can usually find at least two flavors to mix & match. I'm a choco-holic -- so, my fav combo is a chocolate/coffee/vanilla mix with spanish peanuts, coconut & topped with hot fudge!! Sounds almost like a tin roof sundae? YEP! 

However, on a couple of visits, they did not have the coffee (or cappucino) flavor yogurt. Bummed ... But, I found Cake Batter flavor or cheesecake flavor is a decent substitute if need be.  Samples are always available in little cups, which is a good way to figure out the perfect concoction. One of these visits, I'm going to have to try the fruit flavor frozen yogurts -- in particular, lemon & raspberry together. ... But, it just seems every time I go in there, I crave the chocolate & hot fudge experience!! Prices are based on the weight of yogurt & toppings in an ample cup. So, it can get expensive -- and you never know how much it will be until it's weighed at checkout.  Be sure to pick up a Menchie's Passport -- sign up online and use your passport card with every purchase to accumulate points to get a $5 credit with every 50 points. 

On my last visit to Menchie's, the store was selling ""Paws"" in support of the Cleveland APL (for which I volunteer) -- I bought a few ""paws"" that were immediately posted on their wall. The clerk was a slightly older woman (40s-50s) and she was a dynamo! She was happy, friendly, knowedgeable on flavors, specials, and the APL charity. She was a very good face for this Menchie's store in Westlake (Crocker Park).

I also got her vanilla lemonade.  I ordered it as a slush, which was way too good.  The only problem is that it had very large chunks of ice in it, which made drinking it awkward.  I'd suggest not getting the slush; just keep it simple and get it as a liquid.

I can see us returning for happy hour and potentially a pre-dinner sort of situation.  If I want to have a real (full) meal, I've got a list of other places we can go visit for that.",0,6sAgPnZlzie8odlIogKNyA

I went in to ask for my money back, they charged me for the same service twice (which was never provided).  Practically the first words out of the owner were, ""call 911.""  Yea....I was overcharged, asked for my money back, and have been being harassed from this company ever since!  They are claiming that I am lying about how many times I have even been there!  When in fact, their own stylists are lying about how many times they have done=screwed up my hair and are reporting it differently (OR NOT AT ALL) in their computers!  The first stylist I saw there was LENA=bad haircut!  I came in for it to be fixed by the most experienced person they had, which is what I had requested initially but they decided to give me Lena, with only 3 yrs experience.  After most experienced Sarah had fixed my haircut, I decided to let Sarah do another cut and also dye my hair.  BAD CHOICE!  I would have never had SARAH do my cut or dye again after the first screw up but instead of just giving me my money back like I requested they insisted on fixing it!  And, she did so again the 2nd time, and again the 3rd time!  She is the teacher there, so this is why I allowed it to be her to try to fix it instead of obviously going with a different stylist but since Sarah is the teacher there I figured I was getting the best they had to offer...YIKES!!!  I am obviously the idiot for assuming they actually knew how to do hair in any way at this salon...I take responsibility for being the idiot (I'M TOO NICE!) for allowing them to push me around instead of just refunding my money like I requested the first, second, and third times.  BUT NOW, THEY TOOK IT TOO FAR!  THEY ARE STEALING MY $210, NEVER PROVIDED THE SERVICE THEY HAVE NOW CHARGED ME TWICE FOR AND ON TOP OF THAT THEY ARE THREATENING ME WITH LAWSUITS AND WASTING TAXPAYERS' MONEY CALLING 911 FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN TO COVER UP THEIR OWN UGLY BUSINESS PRACTICES!  SECRETS HAIR SALON IS HORRIBLLE!!!!!!  I actually have it all written down in my calendar (& on my head:() (however, not one of these ""women"" will even listen to or try to help me-instead they just called 911!  The manager, Luann, (with the full support of her owner=evil!) threatened me on a voicemail that they would attempt to get their lawyers involved because I left a comment on Facebook so others will know that these ""women"" will NOT only screw up your hair and steal your money afterward, they are threatening your civil rights!!!!!  Freedom of speech, honesty, & integrity do not even exist in this salon!  And, they actually did call the cops on me and I had to talk to 2 cops when I showed up just for proof of where in their computers it says I have only seen Sarah 2 times!  When I have in reality seen her 4 times!!!!!!!!!!! 1 fix haircut after LENA originally screwed it up + 3 bad haircuts/dye jobs!  HERE R THE DATES: 2/12: bad haircut and dye job (from SARAH), 2/19 SARAH was supposed to fix instead yet another bad haircut and dye job from SARAH, 4/12 SARAH was supposed to fix but received yet another bad haircut & dye job from SARAH!  Of course I was charged the $100 ($65 dye + $35 cut) the first time Sarah did cut and dye (2/12), BUT for some reason she charged me another $110 (dye + cut + $10 gloss) on 4/12, but that was supposed to FIX the crap cut and color she had given me the first and second times!  NOW, THE TOP HALF OF MY HEAD IS BRASSY ORANGE WITH BRIGHT NEON YELLOW PATCHES/HIGHLIGHTS :( & THE REST OF MY HAIR IS AN UGLY ORANGE BROWN :(:(:(  I USED TO RECEIVE COMPLIMENTS ON MY HAIR EVERYWHERE I WENT UNTIL I STARTED COMING TO THIS SALON, NOW EVERYONE I SEE SAYS ""IT'S NOT TOOOO BAD:(""  I have seriously gotten the exact same haircut at Great Clips & Wal-Mart!!!!

Alas, this experience was everything I dislike about corporate restaurants--unenthusiastic employees following a script, slow and incompetent service, uninspiring food.

While I understand that a party of 9 is a large group, the restaurant wasn't busy during our time there at lunch, and there seemed to be no cross service to help out our waitperson.  Despite being perhaps 30% full, our lunches took about 25 minutes to deliver.  And the order was incomplete, one entree was incorrect, one not delivered at all.  Too bad it was wings, as it took another 20 minutes for them to arrive--and these too were incorrect.  I guess other than being part of the name, wings are a difficult entree to prepare.

The waitperson apologized, then started complaining about the kitchen staff--true professionalism.  The head host (who introduced herself as we sat and left a flyer with us) never came by to apologize.

Despite us being obviously ready to go after over an hour there, the waitperson had to go back and finalize the bill, which was incorrect.  We were charged for the delayed (and incorrect wings), but were not charged for the incorrect salad entree.  That would somewhat make sense, but it was not mentioned by the waitperson, so I don't know if it was a mistake or intentionally complimentary.

My entree was entirely forgettable (indeed, a few days later I have no recollection of what it was).  I do recall that the onion rings were soggy and greasy.

ICE CREAM: it was very blan and didn't taste any different than regular soft serve. Which is disappointing. They give you a lot of ice cream though. I would say the portions are great for sharing. 

Waffle: it was very fluffy and sweet. I really liked the waffle and how you have many flavours of waffle to choose from. However, your waffle will get wet and soggy by the time you're half way done your soft serve. Half of the waffle will be perfect, the other half is wet and tastes like your melted ice cream.

Debbie Bird {Real Estate agent} showed me the property at Bella Vista. When I first saw it I really liked it because the appliance matched. It was enough room for My husband and I and our 2 pets. 
I immediately got everything in motion so I could go back east and pack. I gave myself 3 days to find a place. I went into Remax Central on Sahara
and met Tobie. Tobie went over the lease. I told her my husband and cat will come later has he was finishing up things back east. The rent was 
$699. I paid a pet deposit of $300 for my Pom among other fees. I told Tobie  my husband and cat will be here later on in the year. She said as soon as they get here we will have to pay another pet deposit for the cat. No problem. Tobie and I agreed on that. I left Las Vegas with the lease stating $699 a month. I signed a year lease. Gave money for a year lease. 
I signed the lease in March. I did not move in until May18.  
In the middle of April I get an email from someone name Laurine Huynh from Remax Central stating that I will have to pay for my cat before I get there. I wrote back and told her Tobie and I agreed that when my husband and cat get to Las Vegas just come into Remax and pay another pet deposit.
Laurine Huynh Very Nasty person said Tobie is not a leasing agent she filled in for her because she was on pregnancy leave. I said well how was I suppose to know what position Tobie is and did not know who  Laurine is. I have never heard of you.
First I thought it was a scam. So I wrote Tobie she said Laurine is the leasing manager. I talked to Laurine and told her Tobie and I had an agreement I signed a lease with Tobie not with you. I also stated to her so everything Tobie said was a lie? Her words were that's not what I am saying. I said yes it is because if it was not then why are you telling me something totally different from what tobie and i discussed in March and a lease i already signed.
I left Las Vegas thinking the rent was $699.
It changed to I had to pay for my cat deposit right at that moment even though I did not know when my husband and cat would be here.  Another fee came up $50 extra a month for my husband and cat. I said for my husband and cat are you kidding me. She wrote back and said: 
Because you are adding extra people. What?? extra people? How is my husband an extra person. This is a 2 bedroom 1 bath condo.On the application said will except pets 2 maximum. I had already agreed to pay a security deposit for my cat even though I did not know when they would be there. Then another total came up. She said I would have to pay extra $75 for an extra inspection. WHAT!!!??? The lease I signed with Tobie already said it was going to be inspection every 3 months. Which was no extra money to me. So I have to pay for extra inspection for what month? They were already going to inspect it every 3 months so basically she was trying to make me pay for inspection that was already in the lease.
JOHN and RUTH AHLBRAND is the owner of that Remax on 8400 W Sahara so i received in my email something that wanted me to give them my automatic signature
I never signed that. But i did sign for extra fee for $50 more a month for rent for as they sated: EXTRA PEOPLE. I could have said NO but that would have meant i would have to come back to Las Vegas and start over. Laurine even said i could pay the extra $50 for the whole year if i wanted to. I said NO. I will pay it monthly.
They already had a year worth of rent from me and now they were going to have $50 more a month for my husband and cat. They thought they was going to get that $75 for an extra inspection which i fought NOT to give. 
When i got here in May2014 the air condition was broke. I spent 3 hot days in that apartment. I have high blood pressure, heart failure and i am disabled. The microwave was filthy underneath. The refrigerator was not cold. They had to replace all of that. She talked about me paying for that old nasty microwave. But they realized it was old and nasty underneath the vent. I guess i was so relieved to get a place {I was only in town for 3 days} i really did not look underneath the microwave.
Derek the repair man {extremely nice} had to replace the bulb in the stove. When he pulled the stove out OMG there was dog food, dirt, a dog toyand a lot of food crumbs. 
Everything was wrong got fixed or replaced but not without the attitude of Re/max.
I never hung anything on the walls while we lived there. I did not want them try and nickle and dime us when we moved which was this year. Long year in that apartment. We hired Maria House Cleaning service to clean and that place looked cleaner after we left than before. The stove had so many marks on it i thought it was part of the stove being everything was old except of the cabinets. The cabinets were changed over in all the apartments when they changed to condos.

Next, the waitress disappeared for twenty minutes after taking most of the drinks sans three people. So three people were drinkless for half an hour while everyone else had their 'adult beverages'.

Note that their signage is a bit faded and the storefront looks like it might be closed from the outside- it's in the same little building as the diabetic sweets bakery, and seems to have popped up overnight.

EDIT: Dropping a star. Service has been lacking the past couple of times I've been here. They're open late but manage to make me feel like I'm inconveniencing them if I pop in and interrupt their chat time as the only customer after 10PM.",21,bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw

Talking with no smartphones.. it was horrible. The interior is dark, cool, polished and has a sleek modern appearance. I prefer this kind of environment that's very dark, so if this isn't your thing you may not enjoy the atmosphere. Perfect for a romantic date night. I ordered a mojito and it tasted like a very watery mojito with barely there liquor and a few mint leaves floating around in the glass. Sent it back and ordered a sangria instead which was much better. I am fortunate enough to have access to some of the best wines, so I never really order their wines here. They offer cabinets to store your own wine. The jumbo shrimp cocktail sauce was bland to my shrimp cocktail. Lucky Wishbone where are you?!?! I longed for just a bit of horseradish..
The BLT crab cakes were fried crisply but lacked color, and appeared a little unappetizing but tasted like meaty crab. The filet mignon sandwiches and prime cheeseburgers arrived hot but the filet mignon was a little overcooked and on the tougher side than normal. I think they were having an off night I guess because the restaurant was absolutely dead inside until it started to pick up at the end.

The hotel and casino are beautiful and fairly easy to navigate (which is saying something for Vegas which has famously confusing casino floors). We had an excellent experience with the front desk staff - Luis was extremely professional and helpful for us in securing our room upgrade. Our room was amazing and the housekeeping staff did a great job. 

There is a lot to do on site at the Mirage. The Mirage volcano (which underwent a $25 million upgrade I believe) was brand new to us on this trip - the past times we had been it was under construction. Definitely do not miss this! The pool at the Mirage was awesome although nothing too different from most resort pools I have been to. The Paradise Cafe (located by the pool) had great service and food. 

It's not advertised but the Sigfried and Roy Tiger Habitat offers a $3 per ticket discount to Mirage hotel guests if you show your room key. We gladly took advantage of this and enjoyed seeing all the animals. 

The Beatles Revolution lounge (located just off the casino) has a really cool ambiance and atmosphere, but $9 for a Heineken bottle is a bit excessive. We loved the Beatles Love Cirque du Soleil gift shop - sadly we could not get tickets for the show, so we spent a good amount of money in the gift shop buying souvenirs instead.

One downside to staying at the Mirage is the $20/day resort fee and additional tax that is charged not only on the room but the resort fee as well. To their credit, they are up front about the resort fee - it was NOT hidden, we were well aware of its existence before we booked our room.",2,_ggGvkTtaJc-w591Lc115g

I am digging this place. The night we went it was a Sunday night and the place was full but not overly so that you can't walk around the place. Lots of comfy leather chairs to lounge on, good music and a full bar that won't keep you waiting. The inside has dark and rich tones, lots of framed art- from the odd to the strange, decorated ceilings and lots of things that catch your attention. I like that they have some private rooms that is ornately decorated- seems to be a harem styled room-swags of cloth, rich decoration and lots of gold and reds. That night they had a burlesque performer...very fitting for this place. 

The main attraction here is the view and the lights of Sin City. The view is spectacular...amazing. I heard the Foundation Room seems to be members only but once in a while, they do open this place to the public. If you can, go...it is nice change from the big clubs on the strip and the views will have you appreciating vegas a lil bit more.",5,v6J_GeMsl6XTT-ZsV6ApHA

I've stayed in the Deluxe Suite, corner Business Suite (Rm 6002) and Vdara Suite (Rm 43010).

The Business Suite and Vdara Suite are basically the same except that the view from the business suite that we were in was the Aria Shuttle (looks like the Disneyland monorail). The view at our Vdara Suite was pretty nice, we could see the strip, including the bellagio water show.

List of things that impressed me:
- kitchen sink/stove/cabinetry
- separate door for the bedroom
- pull out sofa, dining table
- full sized stainless steel refrigerator
- electronic blackout curtains/shades
- washer/dryer set
- bathtub
- 2 free water bottles per night

List of things we needed to call for:
- extra towels
- setting up the pullout sofa
- detergent
- pots/pans/cookware
- extra soap

Convenience Store
The walk to the nearest convenience store is a few minutes away. Around the roundabout to Aria and through Aria's entrance, you'll immediate see ""Elements"" which is Aria's 24/hr convenience store.

Cosmopolitan
We found that walking outside alongside cosmopolitan was the quickest way to get there. It beats walking through Aria, then the mall, then over the bridge.

Earl of Sandwiches
Again, walking right alongside the Cosmopolitan hotel was the quickest way to get to Earl of Sandwiches.

Planet Hollywood vs Vdara - Go Vdara
If your decision is to either stay at Planet Hollywood or Vdara, I would probably stay at Vdara based on the quality of the room that you get for the price. No, it doesnt have a casino, but think of that as a good thing, for most.

Customer Service
The front desk was extremely attentive to our needs. Housekeeping was fairly quick, with the exception of check-in times. Make sure to request that your sofa bed get done when the sun is down, you'll get a lot quicker service this way. Be nice to your housekeeping lady that fixes up your room because most likely, she'll be the one fixing up your room the next day as well, tip her the first day at minimum.

Late Night Munchies
Sorry, no late night munchies at Vdara except for room service, you'll have to walk to Aria for that.

Cafe Downstairs
The food takes about 20 minutes to get, so you'll have to be patient. Luckily, I was working on my laptop using my tethered internet, so it was a pleasant time while I was there.

Free Wifi (512kbps included)
Don't expect fast internet, it's slow, for free. Fast if you pay? I'm not sure, I didn't rely on their internet, I just tethered.

AT&T iPhone 5 Reception
The reception is good when you're on the lower floors. I had LTE on the lower floors. However, up on the 43rd floor, it took forever for pages to load while browsing. Reception was also a bit choppy for the people I was talking to on the phone. It's not the hotel's fault, it's just that I was too high up.

Pool
Don't expect much, it's a little pool with a bunch of seats to lay down on. They provide towels. They check your room key before letting you enter. There's a large rectangular spa as well. The music is ok, could be louder and more modern selection.

In short, my stay was great.",6,tCfKY7zsd4a5JKTEoFQgfQ

I placed my order online for a large steak and onion pizza with their garlic white sauce.  Paid with my card online, drove down at my specified time, and they were just getting it out of the oven.  The lady at the shop was welcoming, smiling, and friendly.

The pizza?  Not too shabby!  The toppings were pretty skimp, but overall, the crust was good, the cheese was just enough, and the sauce was tasty.  A tad salty, but not horribly bad where you need to grab a glass of water right away.  Me and my buddy split the pizza and he thought it was pretty tasty.

A prior reviewer lamented that it turned its back to the street and is now open only to the rear parking lot.  In Phoenix-speak that is a betrayal of right-thinking anti-sprawlism. I agree.  Maybe a small point, maybe not.

It has a menu now!  The food keeps to the same standards as the pastries and beverages, which probably explains why there's almost always a line at the counter and rarely a 4-top available.

- The showers had (note ""had"") a eucalyptus spray that infused the shower but now it's just a dangly wire with 2 green beads? Weird that the product was discontinued but that thing just hangs there with a large sign to ""Try it out.""
- The Aquavanna room is a small spa for 6 people, 2 of those seats were tiled lounge seats. It was a tight fit to get 6 people in there.
- The Aroma room is a semi-sauna with indian chanting and good smelly stuff steaming ""herb scented air."" 
- Was definitely not impressed with the Igloo - a small room (not sure if its meant for a few people or a private experience) but a cold mist/stream of water shoots down over you... and it smells pretty...?

However, if you're looking for a nicer dinner with a great atmosphere Taza's is your place. They make their own fresh pita, playfully names ""puffy pita"" by some, served with olive oil and zataar. I'd highly recommend ordering any of the meat products as they are each grilled to perfection on what must be a wood fire grill. 

My favorite plate is the Lamb Plate that can be ordered in two sizes, depending how much meat you want (I recommend eating it with the garlic sauce). The perfect wine pairing is the red Adyar wine. This wine is made in Lebanon and can only be found at Taza's or Aladdin's",0,MCGl_2vm3dQvB-6mBcMspQ

There's a trio of flavors for the pierogi, and they're all good but the cabbage and mushroom is my favorite. Whichever you decide on, they're served in the traditional style topped with sour cream and fried onions, and they are comfort food to the max! The bratwurst sausage, dressed with cabbage and mustard, is the perfect compliment to a pint inside at Banger Brewing. Quality is solid, prices are a bit inflated due to the location (5 pierogi for $8!) but not outrageously so- the sausages and sandwiches are generous portions.

Atmosphere 
- Nicely themed restaurant, especially for the area. Good decor and vibe, place is clean and nice ambient lighting. Good for casual, family, dates.  Had to wait longer then expected for the food and bill, make sure you go with someone you can talk to cause time goes by slow. 

Menu
Your general bistro items, sandwiches, starters ( shrimp, fries, poutine, pasta, steak.... ) The mains are similar to any steak house. When it comes to pricing its a tad high then similar places, but $20 average for a main is nothing major. 

Food 
Its okay. Unfortunately the stuffed chicken which was on the menu, is no longer offered. Got substituted with an 8oz chicken breast, some veggies, and mash potatoes, doesn't come with any sides. Chicken was good, but a bit small in my opinion. Sauce was amazing, thick and creamy with good flavor. Mash potatoes was gritty, felt like it came out of a box. Not sure if its normal or if its a bad batch but would not recommend the mash potatoes. Steak was good, they know their cooking temperatures, good steak sauce. Similar complaints, small portion and mash potatoes. 

Overall
Its okay, but not sure if I will come back again for dinner, or for any of the mains. The wait time for the food and bill was a bit annoying, and food was nothing major. Maybe I'll try their sandwiches, some of them look interesting. The location and convenience is whats going for the place, and with it being halal attracts wider crowd.

We settled on Kokyo after passing by a couple other restaurants. A very nice waitress greeted us at the front door and we were seated in the outdoor patio area. The plastic lawn chairs were scuffed and old looking. There was duct tape around the outer edge of all the tables. To hide chips and cracks? Who knows. 

We ordered 4 rolls: Spicy Tuna with tempura flakes; Cucumber; Salmon; and Honolulu. The prices were pretty cheap compared to the sushi place we frequent in our hometown, so we thought we were getting a deal. 

When the rolls came out my first thought was: Holy sh*t I hope we don't get food poisoning from this. I don't know if it was the chef's first day out of school or what, but they were the sloppiest looking rolls we've ever seen. They looked like they were falling apart. And the pieces were sliced so huge, it was almost impossible to eat them in one bite. You could either try to shove the whole thing in your mouth and hope you could chew it enough to swallow, or try to take two bites, which effectively destroyed the piece and made a mess. I settled on taking two bites each, dealing with the mess to avoid choking.

As for the taste, it was MEH. We are really spoiled when it comes to sushi, our local sushi place consistently puts out exceptional food. The cucumber roll was just a (huge) chunk of cuke surrounded by rice, so it's hard to go wrong there. The Honolulu roll was good, but the avocado had some brown spots on it. The Spicy Tuna roll tasted just the slightest bit off. It looked fairly unappetizing, which probably colored our opinion. I liked the texture of the tempura flakes though. The Salmon roll was also ok. We left several pieces on the plate. We just didn't want to finish them.

Thoughout dinner there was one particularly agressive fly that would not leave me alone, and little birds hopping around the patio. Not very relaxing when you're trying to eat. Overall, I would say skip this place. I'm sure you can do better.",3,x3EXqdIBQu2socGckHl3Tw

We checked in on Monday evening where our room seemed fine enough for what we paid. Sure it isn't the cleanest but for $30 something dollars a night you can't be too picky. We unpacked everything that we had for our seven night stay, when we realized there was no key to our in room safe. We called the front desk and they offered to move us right then. We moved to a room two doors down and packed and unpacked all of our things yet again. The next day, we found a small cockroach in the bathroom and a few moments later, a very large cockroach climbing up the wall above our bed. We went down to the front desk to show them what we just came across and they didn't even bat an eye.... That was extremely disturbing to me, that both women working did not seem the least bit alarmed at the sight of two cockroaches found in their hotel!!! They offered us yet another room but we were on our way out to a pool party and we're already running late. So we moved to our third room later that evening. Packed up all of our things again and moved them all upstairs.. We got through the next day without a cockroach sighting in our new room, up until just now! I went into the bathroom and there was a giant one sitting on my tooth brush!!!!!! I would be leaving but it's an extremely busy weekend here in vegas and everything is either booked or too pricey! Each time I try to contact a manager about our ongoing issue, she 'isn't in'. Very disappointed in spending my vacation here, it has been a headache and a disaster. 

Save yourself the trouble and pick somewhere else!!!

Okay I'm a sucker for these places. You pay for the atmosphere and ambience, not so much the food, although the food/drinks were also not bad.

This place opened up sometime last month, and it's a popular hangout spot for students and young professionals who want to...I won't go there. You get what I mean. The waitresses in the restaurant are called ""maids"", which is consistent of what many female servers in Japan are regarded to as. Note that on weekends there's a $10 minimum charge each person.

I've been here twice now, both times ordering a chocolate lunar cheesecake. The first time I tried the matcha latte, while the second time I tried the matcha green tea. I also ordered an angel plate the second time around, where the maid gets to draw (or write) a custom message on the omelette using ketchup.

The chocolate lunar cheesecake was surprisingly very good both times, and was definitely worth the ~$6 charge. As for the matcha drinks, I preferred the latte over the tea, as the tea was way too bitter for my liking. The omelette in my angel plate was surprisingly fluffy, similar to their original cheesecakes. Everything else in the plate was nothing special, but hey it was something neat to try.

If you're lining up in the original Uncle Tetsu store and are wanting to buy an angel hat cake, come here instead. They have a wide selection of angel hat cakes for takeout and you don't have to wait an hour in the old lineup.

Service was very good, and you can tell the maids love what they're doing. Their accents can be a bit rough at times, so do be patient in communicating. Either way I'd definitely return here, maybe to catch a show in the future (both times I went during the day).",2,1kNsEAhGU8d8xugMuXJGFA

When I presented my ID the clerk asked my why I haven't picked up my mail, and since I don't think I need to explain myself to her I didn't answer.  She proceeded to tell me that I must answer her, so I told her I was busy.  She said that wasn't good enough.  I haven't been treated that way since I was in the third grade.

After threatening to stop delivering all mail to my home she finally got my mail which included several large packages that wouldn't have fit in my mailbox anyway.

When did it become my obligation to go out of my way to pick up piles of junk mail that I proceed to throw directly into the recycle bin, just to keep from inconveniencing the USPS?

Though I was told the enchilada was spicy and filling, the burger was a huge disappointment. A small patty, equivalent to the size of a McDouble was provided to me, but came with no sides, and a severely undercooked patty. I'm all for having a medium rare beef patty on my burger, but this was just too rare for my liking and too expensive for what you get.

sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,0,2015-02-02,0,JTEuUfuzWUawpVIPE2pCwg,0.0,"I'm from the Midwest area, which authentic Japanese dining is very limited. Everytime I visit Vegas ( at least twice per year), I would make a reservation for Raku. The restaurant is limited in space and highly rcmd reservation (they usually seat reservation in one of the private booth/room). Rcmd checking out the bathroom which has a fish tank and heated toilet.  I've been to Raku for few times and these reviews are based on all the items i've tried. Sometimes, there may be a language barrier and was difficult to understand the type of fish or entree for the daily special. 

Skewers: The price on the menu is for one skewer. Skewers are cooked over a special type of charcoal from Japan, therefore you would really taste a bbq/charcoal flavor in the meat.

Kobe tendon - Rcmd sharing this skewer with others. The tendon which is good fat, would melt like butter in your mouth. Don't consume too much of it because it very heavy in taste. I would just take a bite of it for sampling. 

Kobe beef filet with wasabi - $12 a skewer for kobe filet which was a thick cut. It was good, but it was okay. Maybe it was too well done, I prefer medium rare. Personally, I think the kobe skirt which was thinly sliced tasted better.

kobe beef outside skirt $8- One of my favorite skewer, the beef was tender and tad of charcoal taste to it. Not too overdone and just right. 

beef tongue - delicious and it's a bit crispy and bouncy to the taste, 

Kurobuta Pork cheek - Very tasty. Love it.

chicken - I always order the wrong chicken or  different chicken skewer but it's all tender and juicy,

yellowtail $7 - Good deal for a tasty filet of yellowtail with glazed sweet sauce over it. It was flaming delicious. 

eggplant - direct flamed eggplant that was covered with bonito flake. It was not spectacular, but average.

Regular food item:
Raku tofu - home made tofu that is nicely presented. I usually sprinkle with the matcha sea salt and bit of the house soy sauce. My usual appetizer that i order every time.

Udon with foie gras custard soup - The udon is served cold in a basket and I think it's homemade because it's not the typical thick udon. The foie gras is infused in the egg custard. You dip the cold udon into the warm foie custard soup. Sooo hearty... Unfortunately, i flll up on the skewer and never have room for the udon.

Poached egg with sea urchin and salmon roe - pretty much everything mixed together in a small bowl. It's all raw and raw. The taste was okay and fresh, but not amazing. The texture was slimy Been there, done that.. ill try something else next time

Juicy deep fried chicken - fried chicken and the chicken was juicy and tender. 

Grilled rice ball -  a ball of rice that is fried on the outside. Cool concept, but i'll skip it and save room for the skewers.

Daily Chef's special:
rock fish - The whole fish was served in chunks of sashimi which was sweet and EXTREMELY fresh. My friend and I finished the whole fish. Soy sauce and wasabi is not needed, just chew it raw!!!  It's very reasonable for $45. Later, the bones of the fish was fried and served. This is one of my favorite fish.

wagyu beef sukiyaki - Do you know how difficult to find a restaurant that serves sukiyaki the right way? Most place would just dump the meat and the vegetable in a bowl and serve it.  Raku does it just like how it's done in Tokyo! The vegetable are cooking over a pot of charcoal claypot and the raw meat is placed atop and simmers to your liking. The waiter would crack a raw egg in a bowl and it's used for dipping for the meat. Love IT and i wish there was more meat to it.

Overall, one of my favorite robata grill. After the meal, it's pretty heavy and you might to drink some alcohol with your meal. The plaza that this restaurant is located is a Foodie paradise. In this plaza, there is Sweets Raku, Monta Ramen, Kung fu tea, Snowflake shavery ice, kabuto, Japanese curry, and Japanese Italian noodle (not sure of the name).",3,9Xc7vla9JStodqfaYdJTow

My brisket wrap did not have any horseradish despite the menu saying it would. I choked on the meat it was so dry. And the chicken salad was mostly egg salad.

I am still giving two stars because it was fresh, just not good. So learn to work with the quality and you'll be killing the deli game.

**Smoked Buffalo Wings** 4/5 
Solid wings, with crispy exterior and moist, smoked flesh. 

**Wagyu Flat Iron Steak** 4/5
The steak itself was phenomenal and cooked perfectly, but the accompanying potatoes and sauce were way too salty!

**Special Black Squid Ink Pasta** 3/5
Pasta was cooked a little too soft and the shrimp was over salted. The sauce was milder and less salty, which helped balance the dish, but overall was not too impressed. 

**Pub Burger** 5/5 
Get this! I heard only happy mumbles as my eating companions scarfed down this massive burger. I've heard great things about the burger and was not disappointed. 

**Vanilla Panna Cotta** 4/5

The new Pizzeria Libretto location offers a cool space to dine or grab a beverage.
The pizza is tasty. They use fresh ingredients...sauces...toppings...yadayada.
That's what you get when you pay $15 for a thin-crust pizza cooked in an 800 degree oven for 90 seconds.

The staff -- mostly male -- were qualified, exuded that 'cool' vibe and knew what they were taking about.

My friends were married here several months ago and I have to say that with all the wedding chapels and options Vegas has to offer, this place is over priced and under impressive to me. Their wedding was pre-planned/scheduled in advance, yet when we arrived it was like a cattle call inside when it came to ushering the wedding group in and out. Other brides and wedding parties were waiting in the small waiting area, it felt less personalized this way. The staff was nice, but they moved everyone around frantically, which sort of made all of us feel frantic and rushed.

Sure it looks like a chapel inside, and if that's what you're going for great. But with red carpeting, old white pillars and lattice work it looks like a chapel out of the late 70's; seems tacky rather than classy.

The pros: they have a limo service for the wedding party, to and from any downtown hotel. They will tailor the ceremony to religious needs and wants, like the use of a bible or unity candles, etc.

The cons: pretty pricey - they paid over $2,500 for a pretty basic package that included photos. Also, they don't allow any other photos during the ceremony because the photographer doesn't want her shots messed up.

I suppose all Vegas wedding chapels come off feeling a little cheap, but don't expect it to be cheap on your pocket book.",9,m2vjSXdfs19kNnqUUpAmOQ

For starters we ordered guacamole which was made table-side, nice touch. It was great, and I am not sure but I suspect that the tortilla chips might have been made in-house. If they weren't, then they're darn good forgeries. They were very crispy and didn't taste like they came out of a cellophane bag. 

I also ordered a margarita special which was a Paloma and for whatever reason I got served a double, but they only charged me $6, so lucky me. Beginners luck, eh. 

For mains, we ordered an assorted plate of 6 tacos (2 each of pork, chicken, and chorizo), and a special dish of 3 pork belly tacos with pineapple salsa. They brought out condiments of a spicy mayo and a green sauce that I don't remember the name of. They made a point to mention that the green sauce was made somewhere in Quebec and not in-house. 

There wasn't much difference in the pork and chicken tacos as the veggies were all the same, as well as the seasonings. The meats are shredded in both cases, and well seasoned, but next time I would order a fish taco or something instead of having both chicken and pork, being so similar. The chorizo was spicy and nice, but was very messy and was a bit difficult to eat without getting crumbled meat all over. Maybe I'm not good at eating tacos, I dunno.

The pork belly and pineapple ones were the best, for me. The pork belly was crispy and went excellent with the pineapple. I'll be having those again for sure. 

And because it was happy hour, all our tacos and margaritas were half price, so we got the chips and guac, two plates of tacos, and three margaritas for just under $65 including tax and tip. Way cheap for the amount and quality of food that we had. I'm definitely a brand new fan and will be returning.",0,lsV0a661WYsOuHzbuwKmbQ

In some wonderful family restaurants run by new American families who have come from elsewhere, you feel like you are getting the delicious authentic food, but in an Americanized setting like a strip mall or lower rent neighborhood where they haven't had time or money to try to make it more like home, or show off their culture.  I can totally appreciate and go with that and often actually prefer it because it's the food and flavor that matter to me. In Phoenix, this is true of Khyber Halal, and Da Vang, for example, although they each share with patrons some few homey icons I find lovely (rugs, shrine, respectively).   Other restaurants try harder on the decor and lighting, and it's a miss, because you feel they've kind of thrown up some predictable version of what Americans expect for their country's style, a la Chinese buffet with jello at American truckstop. Actually, I'm rarely a fan of restaurant ambiance, kind of dislike it mostly, especially when I feel I'm being courted (marketed) with that instead of the food.  I suppose the idea is to blend an impression on multiple senses to make dining an experience, but I have found it much more accessible and enjoyable when its not staged for me quite so obviously as it is at cool concept restaurants, not that i don't like some of them.  I think it mostly doesn't work, even in beautiful settings because the best eating experiences to me are intimate, even open-hearted, and its hard to achieve intimate when you are big and successful.  (Which reminds me, I need to review August in New Orleans for gifting me brioche for breakfast after an incredible dinner, when I was agonizing over what I had to forego in the face of so much lusciousness to choose from.)

With that preamble, I'd like to say that the atmosphere, the deep colors, the lighting, I don't know...the feeling of Reathrey Sekong, from its strange-to-my-ears name to the amount of space inside the tiny room dedicated to a ""sofa setting"" of furniture, is kind of wonderful.  Ok, I'm going to say it, poetic.  It's gently happy and softly lit, and just well  put together.   Kind of a perfect smile on the solo server, pretty food, a menu that is charmingly written.  Examples: serving intestines and asking if you've got the ""guts""), and, come on, who couldn't love ""student noodles.""

Taco y taco gives me that option to avoid driving down to the east side but taste and price is at a compromise. 

There is a paper disclaimer in the small walkway to the restaurant warning people that this place is open to foodies with an open mind and some of the options they have will make people turn around. Honestly though... those options are worth the risk. 

Interior: BIG, so big that there is a second floor to eat tacos. Some days they have a dj spinning edm sort of music otherwise it's popular mexican songs. Clean for the most part and they have someone rounding all the tables to wipe up.

Food: Your standard taco joint options with the addition of burritos, and street corn. I always go for the al pastor (spicy pork on a pineapple spit) or the lengua (tongue) always tender with no foul odor. The street corn is just like the ones you'd get from the carts, cheesy with mayo and a slight kick from the tajin. Their burritos are a hit or miss, miss in the sense that the white rice will be mushy and ruin the burrito. Otherwise it's on point and make sure you ask for the cotijas (mexican parmesan cheese) it goes great.

Price: a bit higher than your regular mexican restaurant but not by much.

My chicken was ok, but the steak was overcooked so much it was tough to eat. It was way too busy to get it made again and I was hungry.. sooooo I just ate it. I don't know if I would try this place again, it was very basic. However, there is a very beautiful view of Phoenix from the patio, even nicer with good weather.

For a non-local, I've had the luxury of being a semi-frequent patron of Lotus of Siam. I mean, there's a reason why the wait is notoriously long - I've heard that it's nearly impossible to score a reservation in advance. All of the food I've sampled has been pretty much on point. 

The Nam Kao Tod is my absolute favorite appetizer. Now either I've been under a rock for most of my life or that my Thai food palate is extremely minuscule, the latter may be a bit of a stretch considering I am Thai by blood (not a surprise though), but this is the first time I've encountered that dish. To me, it's the perfect marriage of unique flavors that Thai cuisine is notorious for. I MUST know how they fry the rice to get it to be so crunchy. It's amazing! Don't even get me started on the pork which has a similar taste to the Vietnamese appetizer called Nem Nuong. The perfect amount of lime is added to this dish which helps make it unforgettable. This is a must-try...unless you don't eat pork then I suggest asking for the pork to be served on the side. Get it - you're welcome.

I'd say that the only dish that I have ever been disappointed with was their pineapple fried rice. Go figure right? I mean, how can you mess up fried rice? Well, I shouldn't say mess up... I guess you can say that I was taken aback by the strong, Indian curry flavor which masked the entire dish. Like I said earlier, I've had my fair share of pineapple fried rice due to my previous experience with working at a Thai restaurant and being Thai so I have a pretty good sense of what to expect. It may be dependent upon individual tastes, but I personally think that the strong curry flavor really throws off the flavoring of the dish. I mean, it was so strong that I couldn't even finish my dish and I didn't even bother eating my leftovers (and I'm the leftovers Queen). Would I order this dish again? No, there are many other dishes to choose from, and if you are going to order this, be prepared for its' strong taste of curry.",1,zEAWtjwUPaCDsfuDlKkJaA

Every person on the wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable and the managers were gracious and accommodating. Because it was our anniversary we each received a complimentary glass of Bastianich's own Brut upon arrival (normally $14 a pop), but more notably, because we are locals, we received 15 % off our entire bill. I believe Batali is the only chef thus far to offer such a discount on a regular basis, and he should be commended for it. 

For an appetizer we ordered the pappardelle with 'porcini trifolati,' or cooked porcini mushrooms($22). Porcini mushrooms are my favorite mushroom. They are generally large and have a sponge-like underside rather than gills, giving them a kind of chewy yet slippery texture. When I saw porcini I got incredibly excited because the only place I have seen fresh porcini mushrooms in the states is at the Ferry Building farmer's market in San Francisco. While living in Italy they could be found everywhere in the Fall, even at road stands, and I frequently ordered this exact dish whenever I could. Needless to say I was truly disappointed when the dish came out full of shitakes and other varieties of mushrooms, with nothing like the porcinis I know and love. If the menu had just said 'pappardelle with mushrooms' I would have been completely satisfied, as the pasta was beautifully home-made and tossed in a light yet buttery sauce. Sadly, this misrepresentation showed up more than once on the menu. Our spinach side was supposed to have cherry peppers to give a kick, yet didn't, and our 'spring peas with pancetta' turned out to be snow peas. 

The steak was the real showstopper of the meal. I try to be frugal when dining out, but as a self-proclaimed foodie I am also willing to pay big money for something novel and ridiculously good. That something today was the 240 day dry-aged steak that cost $100 an inch. Dry-aging of beef is basically the controlled rotting of the exterior of the meat in a cold environment that results in the formation of a skin, or pellicle, that is then removed prior to cooking. It is an expensive process and therefore results in better, but less frugal, cuts of meat. Most well-marbled high grade meat is dry-aged for some amount of time as it dramatically enhances and concentrates the flavor, but this time can range from a few weeks to about the 240 days given the riserva steak here (we were told the slaughter date for our beef was circa early August, 2009). A second manager prepared it for us tableside by skillfully slicing it on a wooden board and drizzling it with the chef's recommendation of a little olive oil and a sprinkle of salt. We ordered the horseradish black pepper zabaglione as an accompanying sauce, but despite its ethereal qualities, it was utterly unnecessary and almost felt like a sin to use on this particular piece of meat. The inherent flavors of the steak were not powerful enough to stand up to it, and only by eating the steak alone could you truly appreciate the process and time required to create such a masterpiece. The wait staff described the flavor as earthy, but for me it was as if the aroma you get when you first walk into a fabulous cheese store (such as Murray's in the West Village) found its way into the meat and then ultimately into your mouth in a subtle yet obvious way. Combine that with the intensely flavored juices of the best quality steak you can buy and the result is unlike anything you've had before. As I continued to analyze the complexity of flavors twinkling in my mouth I looked over at my husband and saw teardrops welling in his eyes. When he noticed I was looking at him he said, ""I'll cry over meat, I don't give a f*#!."" I was hoping he was tearing up over how happy he felt to be married to me, but no, it was the steak he was feeling such a fondness for. I really wasn't hurt at all because I felt the same, and in all fairness, you can't have a steak like that everyday for the rest of your life. 

As far as Strip restaurants go, I would be more inclined to come back here rather than try some of the other celebrity chef restaurants I haven't yet been to. Usually you don't get what you pay for, but I felt the prices charged here were deserved. To boot, the service and ambiance were top notch without being stuffy. If you are looking for a special occasion place, Carnevino is now on my list of top ten Strip restaurants.

Even though the trail crosses several major roads the trail is very quiet and relaxing as it cuts through residential neighborhoods. Each major road has an underground path so that you don't have to cross busy roads. I was glad to find this option as it seems like a much safer way to travel the path. 

The path was free of garbage and animal waste. We saw volunteers cleaning up the area close to the wash as we walked too.

One thing that bugged me was the front desk. Coming from hospitality, it's surprising how few front desk agents they had during the busiest of check-in times. We were standing in line to check in for a good half hour or so and the line went out the door. Once we got to the front desk agent, she was friendly, but no apologies for the wait or anything extra.

The staff aren't chatty, which suits me just fine, particularly since there's always some charming movie on the TV screens.

They are also very clean - all metal equipment is sterilized and comes in individual packs so that it remains sanitary.

When I went in this week for their rotation they told me they could not rotate the tire because the front tires were worn off on both sides below the wear points. This was due to the fact that they set the air pressures to low in those tire. They only had 14lbs of pressure in them, and they should have been at 30lbs. The tires were rates for 60K miles, but they only had about 10k on them. The new set they put on the rear had 24lbs in them, and they looked fine,  but they should have been at 35lbs. Discount would not stand behind their failed work. 

They are the ones who set those pressures wrong, but I could not prove that fact. They tried to say the chrome on my rims was delaminating inside, and that was causing them to lose pressure. That was total BS, because both front and back tires had matching pressures on either side.  I'll be finding a new tire store next time after this.",4,W0DJOPsSwcAj0uqCJG8iLw

Earlier this month (March, 2015) while waiting for my food, a female employee began vigorously sweeping the entry rug located INSIDE the front door.  She swept in the direction of the condiment island and the service counter, all the while oblivious to the cloud of dust she was creating in the room. In a matter of seconds, the entire room was engulfed in dust.  It was so bad, in fact, that I was compelled to go outside, where I could breathe. 

Not only did the dust settle on the condiment cart and its contents, but it migrated into the kitchen where my food was being prepared. NOTHING was said by any employee about the dust cloud as it lingered in the kitchen AND SETTLED ON MY FOOD. It was DISGUSTING! DISGUSTING DISGUSTING!

This experience has led to my loss of confidence and trust in the cleanliness of Roberto's shop and the safe preparation of food at this location. It has also caused me to doubt the manner in which Roberto's other shops are being operated.

I had a blast it was a Tuesday and of course the family has about 4 women who wanted to go shooting so we came back on that day and it was FREE!

The wait was an hour, so we had time to kill and drove down the way and had lunch, but we got back and we were good to go. We rented 2 ""lanes"" or whatever their called. One for small hand guns and the other for big rifles. Both my cousins own those guns, not sure if this place rents guns or not. Our group was about 9 people, only 3 people at a time can enter.

Having never been to a shooting range, it was quite intimidating, my bad for starting with the rifle because it scared the s*** out of me. 308 caliber, that thing was a monster. But once I got over that ""fear"" I was good to go. My sister and I are both pretty petite but we took turns with the boys and it was super fun!!

With that being said, i wasn't too thrilled about this dining experience either. The place was dimly lit with no open blinds so it was like walking into a cave that reeked of old cafeteria food. Me and my friend ordered the fried pickles as an appetizer, the pick-2 fajita combo - chicken and steak - ""cadillac style"", and 2 beers. My total bill was over %70. The fried pickles were extremely salty with little to no breading. The fajita toppings arrived 5 mins before the actual entree. The entrees arrive to our table.  I noticed mine had a lot of extra meat. My friend's portion was barely adequate for a small child let alone a grown adult. The steak was very fatty and not ""heated"" properly. The beans were watery and very heavily salted as well. I don't think that each and every menu item has to be ""chipotle"" style, even though yes it is a southwestern restaurant. My only complements on this experience were a) the server was extremely attentive to our needs, even though she was more heavily focused on serving her family at the next table over, and b) the use of self -serve touchscreens at each table, which allowed for drink refill requests, desserts, paying the check, which was cumbersome at best, and game apps for the kids, if you didn't mind shelling out $1.99 for games that come free on most cell phones.

My family (on both sides) has lived in NM for many generations. So I would like to think I know my NM food (I can cook it up and I was raised on it.) 
This place had been on my list for quite a while now. I am always in search of good NM cuisine, especially when I am not in the mood to cook it all up myself. 

I had stopped in one Sunday morning and was unwilling to wait for a seat. So I turned around. Vowing to try it again another day. 
Well folks Friday (2/11) was that day. Parking on the other side of the chinese restaurant, I walked towards the entrance hoping I could get in, as it was a Friday after 6pm. 
My timing was impeccable. There were 3 open seats at the bar, but I only needed one. The restaurant is dimly lit and the aroma of smoke from their grill lightly permeates the restaurant. Smelled faintly of my grandmothers kitchen, as she still uses a large wood cook stove to prepare most of her meals. 
Taking a seat at the bar, the stools wobbled and I feared my phat ass would end up on the floor so I tried not to move around too much as I begin my wait. Admittedly they were busy and the place is quaint and cozy (aka small). . A couple that walked in 10 min after me claimed the 2 seats next to me at the bar and waited with me for another 5+ minutes. WHAT?! The waiter/manager walked up and handed them menus...as he turned to leave and fetch them some water, I turned back politely and asked him for a menu and water also. (Feeling a bit invisible as I had been waiting for a bit and couldn't get anyone's attention.) The man sitting next to me passed me his menu as he knew what he was already going to order. 

Receiving my water and finally able to place an order for a beer, I continued to watch the guys at work in the kitchen as the flames and red coals from the wood fired grill lured me into a daydream that distracted me from making a decision on what to order. 
Luckily to took them awhile to take my order. I couldn't make up my mind they had a great menu and some wonderful looking specials on the chalkboard behind me. 

Finally, I decided on the Taos Combo they had on the specials board, which included 2 Schriners New Mexican sausages, 2 bacon wrapped grilled shrimp and 2 rolled blue corn green chile enchiladas stuffed with cheese and lightly smokey cubes of pork and rice and beans of course. 
Once ordered it came out relatively quickly. Very generous portions served on their famous metal platters. Everything was delicious and well seasoned (simple). The flavors imparted on the sausages and shrimp from the wood grill were delicious and the shrimp were perfectly tender. The blue corn tortillas were real blue corn, not white corn with blue dye like I experienced at another restaurant recently. 

So much food I took more than half home for leftovers later. 

So why 4 and not 5 stars....I was pretty much invisible to the staff for the first 15 minutes of my visit. They did get busier later but they are experienced at handling a crowd. I shouldn't have had to wait so long initially.",5,gH3JDpHQfVcMEGaAaCJPjA

After about the 3rd day her feet were worse and she was in worse shape than before she got this machine. So she called them and the woman told her to use it twice a day for 30 days and she should be good, so back on the machine she went and it got so bad that her feet were burning all day and all night, so called the office again, and the woman actually told her that if it is not working for her ""Maybe you better put it on Kijiji and try to sell it for $200.00 or whatever you can get for it as we do not do refunds""

I came into Design me for the Opalex treatment on just my bangs to help repair some of the damage and get a trim up on them. Zoey was my stylist and I am so happy with the way my bangs turned out! I've always cut them myself because no one had ever gotten them perfect but she took her time and made sure they were even and they turned out absolutely perfect! 
The Opalex treatment is great! Better used with the take home product as well, to keep the damage from getting worse on its own.

We love the option to use the kid area pool or the adult area pool depending on how crowded either one is. The spa in the kids area is large enough that you can sit and have a conversation with your spouse without feeling like you're sitting right on top of the people next to you (large enough for 70 people we're told). The rooms are perfect for the essentials, you have a fully functional kitchen, which is amazing. The bathrooms are spacious and the water pressure in the shower is always great (this is a big deal for me, I hate not being able to get the shampoo out of my hair or getting shot in the eye with a stray stream of water). The adult area pool has a great little bar, and the prices aren't bad. Best part of that is being able to charge it to the room so you don't have to bring your CC to the pool. Great little gym on property. Gorgeous scenery if you want to walk around. Lots of day trips available for a price. There is an actual spa attached to the resort, and I'm sure the treatments are wonderful, but I feel they are a bit pricey. 
My husband loves being able to check out bbq tools and we will usually bbq a nice steak one of the nights we are there. The people at the front desk are always very helpful and if there is an issue with your room they can usually send someone right up.

We found Naima and decided to do a makeup trial even though she had mixed reviews  online. So we went to her ""studio""  which is someone's basement. (Let's ignore how awkward that was.) And the first thing I noticed was how unorganized and messy her makeup area was. It literally looked like there was an explosion. Makeup on top of makeup. Products on top of products. Completely unprofessional. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and ignored it. But then she started her makeup. I noticed Naima was using dirty brushes on my sister. I was going to gag because it was so gross but I kept my mouth shut. I was honestly worried my sister was going to break out or have some sort of skin reaction, she took off the makeup immediately after leaving the trail!!Also noticed that Naima was using low to mid drug store products, she wasn't using luxury or high end products which is odd because the price she was asking for you would expect everything to be top notch. Anyways she did her makeup trial and it took Naima 5 hours (just makeup not hair) even though we told her we needed to be done at a certain time because we drove almost 2 hours to get to her. Overall we were not impressed with the makeup look. It was so standard with gold glitter and such a traditional basic desi look. Honest critic because I do makeup. The contour was off, eyebrows were overly drawn, way too much eyeliner at the bottom which made eyes look sunken, and winged liner was NOT on point!  Your average MAC / Sephora makeup artist can do better and are probably in a lower price and much more sanitary! 
Obviously we ended up not hiring her for the wedding. Looking at some of these reviews, I think it was a good decision. Would not recommend her at all! Just my honest review!",2,4AjSxRzhO1ZelYGDKKwNOA

Sat at the sushi bar & was served by Chef Oscar. The care and expertise he used to slice & create was awesome to watch. The pride he has of his craft was obvious. Check out the sashimi platter picture. That's Golden Eye Snapper adorning that platter. 

Besides eating with your eyes, the taste did not disappoint! Totally fresh, great cuts of fish. Chef Oscar added a bit of roe here, a little uni there to completely elevate the nigiri. Didn't skimp on the thickness of the sashimi, either.

There was one vegetarian choice per course, which is expected and totally fine when it is 3-4 choices per course. The vegetarian choices sounded good and I was really excited before going. 

So, the first course was a caprese salad with one very generous slab of Buffalo mozzarella, one slice of red tomato (a vine tomato I think), and one slice of yellow tomato. The tomatoes weren't great, but it is winter and they're out of season. The dressing was a flavorless olive oil and thin balsamic vinegar, and one leaf of basil. It was okay but would have been greatly improved by smoking the tomatoes, or infusing the oil, or even just using a high quality flavourful olive oil...or more basil. Or even slicing the cheese thinner.

Second course was ""crispy ricotta gnocchi."" This was where it really fell apart. They were battered and over cooked so it was just like hollow, deep fried batter, none of the tender pillows of ricotta gnocchi I'm used to with this dish. It was also over salted and just incredibly greasy...this coming from someone who loves salty french fries or onion rings. I couldn't finish them. The portion was also ridiculously small (I know gnocchi is always a smaller portion but these were mini gnocchi and only came as 8-10 pearl sized balls of grease) and I was really jealous of my non vegetarian dining partners who had plates of fresh pasta, but again, I couldn't finish them anyway. 

I was really looking forward to the third course, risotto funghi, with 4 kinds of mushrooms, because I love mushrooms and was really hungry and already disappointed in the meal. Unfortunately it was the worst course of the night for me. It tasted like campbells mushroom soup that someone had added *extra* salt too. There were clumps of the rice stuck together. The different mushrooms which I picked out all tasted exactly the same, with the same texture, as they'd been overcooked in this mess. There was one whole clove of garlic, but the garlic flavours hadn't penetrated the rest of the dish. It was seriously awful, and my whole table agreed it was inedible. I was really jealous of the sides everyone else's meals came with, like wilted greens. They said theirs was okay but the steaks they request medium rare were unevenly cooked and medium well done that medium rare. There were some generous slices of parmesan on top of the risotto though, and that was the highlight of my meal. 

It isn't like me to not be able to eat my food. I've been to many amazing Italian restaurants in Toronto, Italy, and other countries. I also eat at malls and cafeterias and 7-11. This food wouldn't have been good even if I were drunk (and I did get drunk on all the wine, since I was on an empty stomach as the food they served me was inedible). 

Everyone else enjoyed their food, but were a little disappointed as nothing was outstanding or particularly good quality. It seemed to be a case of them not caring about vegetarian food at all, or maybe their chefs don't know how to work with flavours other than just using meat. The over salting was really jarring. I love salt, but this was disgusting.

Overall, it was one of the very worst meals I have ever been served and the price was outrageous for something I'd be angry and being served at a local pub.

The restaurant is just over the bridge to Southend and actually has a nice view of the city but they score points for offering parking! That's always a win when you are close to the city. 

We entered the restaurant and the hostess opened he door for us with a warm greeting. We were offered a large comfortable booth and our server approached the table quickly to be introduced by the hostess. 

The servers wear paper bow ties and full button down shirts... weird. The atmosphere is of course very rustic and they have a story of an old tobacco house on the back of the menu. It's very dark in the restaurant, mostly lit by candles. They have nice fire pits outside but it was a little too chill for us to venture out there. 

We ordered a bottle of wine for the table. Our server turned the bottle presentation over to a different sever and she broke the cork. They panicked and ran form the table to the bar. I think this flustered her but during a wine presentation you present the cork to the host (or taster) ESPECIALLY when the cork breaks. She didn't do this and I requested to see the cork prior to her pouring. The bottle was fine and we did enjoy it but our server needs to learn to open bottles for her own table.. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and assume she was new.

We showed interest in the Fried Green Tomato app and asked the server about it. She told us it was 2 tomatoes and said it wasn't a great choice to share for our group of 4 but we moved ahead with it anyway. First of all I think all apps should be served with enough for 4 ppl to have a taste. Let's be real that's kind of the point, to share with a group. It was small but it actually had 3 tomatoes and it was topped with crab so we all got about 1-2 bites. The flavor was really nice and the dish arrived promptly. 

We placed our order, 2 people ordered the fried chicken and 2 ordered the shrimp and grits. Our table also ordered sides of fries and Mac and cheese. The food was served in a timely manner. The shrimp and grits was presented nicely and reviewed very high from our friends. I was a bit disappointed in my friend chicken. First of all the dish is $21 dollars and it comes with one side of creamed corn. The portion is way to small for the money. I think that it should be a two piece dinner. Also the chicken was very crispy which was nice but it was very dry. I HAD to use the dipping sauce because it was so dry. The dipping sauce that comes with it is a jalape√±o honey sauce which is ok but the bright green color was a little off putting. The Mac and cheese was really quite delicious, very creamy.

They do bring bread to the table and the bread was really great and was served with honey butter! Make sure you try this! 

Overall the menu is a little bit limited so I may give this place another try but they are trying to be a little more fine dining than they are. Your food has to stand up to the price tag and the atmosphere.",4,uy4oHzC_4zqEAn95Kv27Ag

Ordered from ubereats - all the pictures looked like these big stuffed sandwiches and this delicious colorful pasta and these big parm stick rollups...
Well, they didnt have our drinks and never called to tell us. So we had nothing to drink.
The cheese rollups were ONE. the pictures look like you may get a few, they'd be big and cheesey... maybe the size of a long fruit rollup and I could see straight through end to end - not a lot of substance.
The sandwhiches were awful. They were much smaller than I expected, and there was literally nothing in them! One piece of maybe half a chicken finger, a soggy piece of lettuce jammed in the back, you couldn't even see the sauce at all, or anything else... even the pasta, was just noodles with some olive oil. Nothing else.
We were so hungry, ordered $40 worth of food, and didn't even eat half of it because it was just bread and semi dry noodles.
Like I said, I hope it was just a new person in the kitchen or some weird occurance... really sucked. And man if you don't have something someone ordered, please tell them! Eating bread and pasta with nothing to drink is no fun.",1,aWco03ahcuPmnuZSIM89fA

Dr. Toni is completely thorough and caring.  When you see her, she treats you like a friend, makes you feel comfortable, and really cares about your well-being.  On my first visit, we talked for 2 hours about my medical history and health goals.  I have never had an experience like this with any other physician.  

Margie is the best massage therapist that I have ever dealt with.  She is also extremely caring (hugs included).  The work that she performs is amazing, and she takes the time to show you activities to perform at home that will help with pain and stress in the body.  

Chandra, the office manager, has an ""on-your-side"" approach when it comes to dealing with insurance.  She is completely competent in what she does and has such a friendly demeanor, which is rare in a physician's office.

Visually the food look very appetizing especially the protein area with good prime rib, chicken, and other various meats.

I tasted food from the Asian section , the American section, Italian section, and the Mexican section and I have to tell you everything I tasted was very delicious! 

I was not disappointed, the price to get in was $19.95 which is not bad for dinner and even better when the food is very delicious.

Before I left I tried the dessert section and the choices they have for dessert we're pretty good with a lot of variety. They also have a nice gelato section which visually looks very good, and fancy and the taste did not disappoint either.

I believe the salon is open seven days a week, which I was surprised about. They are also open fairly late, which means you can go after work. The place can get quite busy and appointments work best.

They put out a solid menu with some fantastic options and they know that Restaurant Week should be at least a little bit of a deal. (I hate restaurants that just toss three items on their menu that would've added up to $29 anyway.)

I had the fried mac & cheese which was delicious, topped off with a fantastic tomato-chile-salsa type thing. My only complaint here is that it was just this side of not-warm-enough. (The Mac, not the chile stuff, which isn't supposed to be hot.) 

I also had a good several bites of the girlfriend's Stetson Chopped Salad. I understand the hype. It's at once fresh, crispy, and packed with flavor--it's more an experience than a salad. Absolutely perfect and beautiful to boot.

The scallops with beet risotto were just fantastic. The goat cheese was a masterstroke, the scallops were cooked absolutely perfectly, and the dish was just the right size for a three course--three large-ish scallops. The risotto was tasty though it could've used just a little something to perk it up, but the goat cheese did some fantastic heavy lifting on that front. Absolutely awesome.

Finally, the banana cream pudding/pie and the bread pudding. Both hit  the spot, but the banana cream felt a little less special, if that makes sense. The bread pudding was fantastic, but definitely a heavy dish after such a meal.

My insurance company sent me a list of 'preferred' shops and they all had less than stellar reviews. Seeing the wonderful feedback on line about Lovetts, I decided to give them a shop. 

From my 1st phone call, they were a pleasure to deal with. They answered any and all questions, contacted my insurance company when the initial estimate did not fully cover the damages, arranged for additional inspection, & handled the financials directly with my insurance. They called to keep me updated when my car needed additional days in the shop. They even fully explained to me how Hertz works to pick up/drop off rentals at their shop. 

When my car was ready, they informed me that my battery had died while in the shop. They jump started it every day to move it when they worked on it. I wasn't surprised, as it had never been replaced in the 5 years I owned the car & I'd seen some telltale signs that it might be failing. They very kindly offered to get the battery & install it by the time I came to get my car that afternoon, saying that they didn't want me to drive down the road, only to have it die. They even provided me with the invoice, showing what they paid and giving me proof of purchase for warranty replacement if needed. I'll just say that sourcing my particular battery was quite the chore, but they came through and installed it. 

When I got there, one of their wonderful guys had my trunk popped open and was putting a covering back on the inside. He noticed that my license plate light was out, so he took it uppon himself to pop a new one in. So awesome! 

My car was washed & sparkly clean. The repair work was stellar. I really felt taken care of & like they cared about doing great job. I will absolutely use them again & would send any of my friends and family to them.

There are some mainstays on the menu (fried or smothered chicken, for example), and there are daily specials.  We ate at Angie's on a Thursday, when meatloaf is the special.  So, my wife had meatloaf.  This is a traditional meatloaf, tomato sauce, onions, veggies.  Very moist, went well with the mashed potatoes and brown gravy.  We also tried mac n cheese, fried corn, and okra.  Of these, the okra was my least favorite, but I still really liked it.  The fried corn has bacon and veggies in it, it was a style we hadn't tried before.  Both of us liked it.  I'd like to try to replicate this dish at home.  The mac n cheese, as expected, was fantastic.  Classic soul food mac, not based on a roux.  Very cheesy.  

I had the fried chicken.  I was glad I called ahead, because this dish can take 25-30 minutes.  Again, I don't mind since it's fresh, but I highly recommend you call first.  This is a LARGE serving of chicken, 4 pieces, with 2 very large drumsticks.  Both meals at $9.99 for the entr√©e, 2 sides, and cornbread.  Very reasonable considering the flavor and quality of what you get.  The fried chicken was seasoned very well.  I find that a lot of places are too focused on the skin, which is certainly important, and leave out proper seasoning.  Not Angie.  The skin was crispy, adhered to the chicken, and was flavorful.  That's the fried chicken trifecta.

The employees were very friendly.  The place is small and sparsely decorated, but we felt very comfortable.  This is some serious soul food, highly recommended.",4,JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw

unfortunately...things didn't pan out so well.  I've been to the Hard Rock and like the vibe of the casino floor, the music, the memorabilia, and the decided to try the hotel and its amenities.  
the first thing that didn't go as planned was the fact that we couldn't get the King Size bed we reserved for the first night and so they put us in the double Queen.  I couldn't sleep the first night at all!  the beds felt like college futons - small, too soft, and uncomfortable!  I pushed with the front desk and was able to switch which isn't great mid stay.  But the King was way better!
The hotel and casino is huge! we must have walked over 10k steps each day just trying to get around to eat, casino, and pools.  Also, the layout was so disorienting we got lost a couple of times.  Didn't help when we drank - LOL.  
the food and drinks were pretty on the high side and it was unfortunate that some drink and food coupons were not given until the 2nd day there...why? i have no idea.
The pools were pretty nice...very loungey and helped to cool off the 100degree weather we got in August.  
Overall...it was ok.  I always do enjoy the music they play all over the hotel and the music videos constantly playing as well.  Its a younger vibe which is why I like it better than the senior  casino/hotels on the strip.  I hope the Hotel can update some problems since I'd like to go again if its a better trip without so many speed bumps...",0,LkAR6OW-luN8MzTK55sAyg

One big negative was that our a/c was broken and we called them 4 times over a span of 3 hours and the person at the front desk kept saying they were sending maintenance over to fix it.  My butt!  The thermostat read 82 degrees inside when we set it to 50 degrees.  We were sweating our asses off.  That's truly unacceptable, especially for claiming to be a ""luxury"" hotel that charges exorbitant room rates.  Plus, once the maintenance guy came, he said he was only notified about the problem 15 minutes prior!  We were pretty cool about it, but once my friend complained, we got our resort fees waived.

We walked in about 9 am on a Sunday morning. We saw lots of people sitting in the waiting area so we were expecting a wait but luckily the hostess just ushered us in. They have plenty of small tables available for 2- 4 people. Guess there were large groups outside. But by the end of the meal, the place was packed, both inside and out. Anyways, the first thing the waitress said was that the portions are huge. I already knew that and decided to split a dish with someone. The guys each ordered their own dish and ended up boxing up half of it. Hahaha. So I split the house hash with chicken. It was served in a heavy iron skillet along with a biscuit, 2 eggs and fruit. We were starving but it was so much food. The two of us had trouble finishing it. It wasn't that amazing either. The food is just ok. I don't know if I love it or will crave it in the future. It's a little bit greasy. I think their gimmick is just huge portions and I guess their food presentation is pretty good. My friend got the Andy's sage fried chicken eggs benedict (which is a Man vs Food fav) but man it's like almost a foot high, everything piled on top of each other. Looked really good. I only tried a bit of the mashed potatoes and chicken and hollandaise sauce. It was tasty. That dish was like $16 though. Everything is about $15 or more but I guess if it feeds you twice, it's ok. Hard to have leftovers on vacation though and I'm guessing a lot of people that come here are tourists. Oh and the other guy at our table got the combo with a waffle, eggs, sausage, and fruit. The waffle took up like  of the plate and half of the waffle went home with us as well. Haha. Oh and I have to mention service was horrible. Our waitress liked to disappear for long periods of time. She was nice and polite but nowhere to be found. Other people brought out our drinks and food. And we had to flag other wait staff to get an extra plate and boxes at the end.

Afterwards I had no ingrown hairs and the wax lasted a good six weeks. She recently moved to Sybil Salon and even sent me a text message to notify me. I never want anyone else to wax my woman parts as long as I can help it!

Once inside, I was immediately struck by the size of the place. It's at least five times larger than I imagined from passing by outside. Before this, it always seemed like the guests were crammed into the front part of the shop, surrounded by glass on two sides of the building. Whenever I walked by and peered at the coffee-slurpers, I felt like I was passing an aquarium and should drop some food inside.

But my impressions after visiting are completely different. This is a place I can't compare to any other. If I had to attempt to describe it, I'm just going to date myself. Okay so here goes: It's kind of like Record & Tape Traders meets Starbuck's meets local art gallery.

See? Half of you probably don't even know what Record & Tape Traders is. But this is good. It means you've got your youth. Please use it responsibly.

The Beat is more than just a great place to grab coffee. It's a world unto itself. Sure, there's all kinds of excellent coffee. And food. But there's also an art gallery with some truly stunning pieces of work. There's a very large upstairs, too. So don't forget that if you decide to venture into the art realms. Adding to the vibe here, there are some cool classics being piped through the speakers and vinyl albums right there in the shop. Remember those?

Staff is very upbeat, friendly and professional. One even told me I smelled good right after I placed my order. Did I? Probably. My secret? MK High Intensity Cologne. And yes I have a Mary Kay rep. But hey, what a compliment to go with your coffee. 

This is a place where laptops and tablets abound. Deals are done, Tony Hsieh of Zappos grabs his morning fix, and introductions are made several times in one morning. I only know this because I grabbed a seat at a table, fired up my laptop, and blended in with the morning crowd.

And what an eclectic crowd it is. All kinds hang out here. The well-heeled, the working class like me, and some who had clearly just stolen their ipads from someone. A tourist, no doubt. But at least they have good taste in coffee shops.

While not exactly off the beaten path, the Beat Coffeehouse is less touristy than say, the Starbuck's' or Seattle's Bests you'll find on the Strip or under the Fremont Canopy. It's more of a locals joint and a very fun place to grab your morning jolt, or even just to visit.

After the transmission died on my car, local tow truck driver recommended this shop.  Being new to the area, I said ""sure, take it there.""  Big mistake.

I paid close to $4,000 for a used transmission with allegedly 40k miles on it.  I asked owner for paperwork showing where he got the transmission, so that I could verify that it indeed only had that many miles.  Owner refused to provide that.  But that wasn't the worst of it.  IT TOOK THEM FOUR WEEKS TO FIX THE CAR! I tried my best to be patient with them, but every time I called it was some new story as to why they still weren't done. When their various stories started contradicting themselves, I called the owner out on it.  He then started yelling at me for accusing him and his lead technician of lying.  

But wait, it gets worse.  After finally getting my car back, the ""new"" transmission failed within two weeks! I was stranded on the side of the highway about 130 miles from home. I called the shop to ask what I should do, and they said ""go ahead and get it towed to the shop and we'll take a look."" As it turns out, they said that there was a leak in some gasket and the transmission fluid was low, so the transmission was burning up.  Wonderful.  My theory is that they forgot to refill the fluid reservoir when they put it in. Regardless, it was their fault.  I asked the owner if he would help me with the $450 tow truck bill, and he refused, despite the fact that it was his shop's incompetence that caused it and despite the fact that he had offered me a ""12,000 mile warranty.""  

So, make that $4,450 for a used transmission of dubious origins and approximately five weeks total without a car.  Mistake learned.  My only solace is that maybe this review will help someone else avoid the misery this shop brought into my life.",14,x2QhSdw0TH0n88tDbcizgw

I ordered the drake breakfast. It was okay. Offered standard fare but the standout was the cornbread. Damn! I could have eaten way more of that. If you order brunch ask for a side order of the cornbread - yo wont regret it.

I was kicking myself for not ordering some other items that looked much more enticing like the shashuka or huevos rancheros.  Oh, next time.

Staff were friendly and food came out in a timely manner despite our large party.

The pictures however are making me rethink my stance.  A couple years ago I was so excited to go to this restaurant and even got something in the mail with pictures that I brought along with me.  It clearly stated the hours breakfast was served and as far as the ad was concerned we were on time.  However, when we sat down and I tried to order the picture, I was told they don't prepare eggs that way past a certain time of day.  That I could receive eggs prepared the way they said or not at all.  Due to my prior excitement over the picture, and as a customer being told there were eggs in the kitchen, but they would not use them the way they advertised, I was very deflated.  It ruined my appetite, we stood up without ordering or eating and have never been back since.  

I am glad to see so many positive reviews, hopefully I will move past my grudge soon and finally try the food that aesthetically appealed to me before.",2,RyVpd9WTfCC4puHIL8x4CQ

It was cloudy and windy, and rain was threatening, The rapid change in weather just made for a wonderfully cool atmosphere to hang out with my Beloved. The vine draped windows, the hard wood flooring, and the candle lit cozy tables gave it an old world fairy-tale like atmosphere.

We were so enamored with this place's ambiance that we contacted one of our daughters, who enthusiastically decided to join us for dinner. 

After all, it was a free dinner while hanging out with Mom and Dad!

The menu was not extensive, but what they did have; they executed quite well.

I had the Ceviche. And the presentation and flavor of the shrimp was quite appetizing.

My beloved wife and daughter had the Enchilada and the Relleno, respectively. 

Both were quite delectable, and had a neutral taste to it. Not too bland, and not too spicy. Just perfect for their palates.

For good measure, we ordered Flan and Sopapillas. The honey on the Sopapillas were just oh so sweet. The Flan was a little on the tart side, but good enough to be enjoyed.

I have heard rave reviews of this place so I MIGHT consider trying it again.  With a party of 12 they force you to chose from a small, boring fixed price menu ($20).  There were 2 types of omelettes and a basic eggs benedict.  You can also choise beignets or a side salad.  

For $20 I would like more of a choice than a breakfast with 2 eggs and a small salad.
Second, I asked a server there about the menu and why it was that way.  She acted all douchy and said twice ""as your hostess about that.""  Well, who the hell is the hostess?  They sent about 8 people by and no one introduced themselves.  

Service was good except for that BUT they gave themselves 20%!!! What?  First of all, I hate automatic tip taking but second, 20% is what i pay when i have good service and that should be left up to me...especially when you're charging $5 for an egg.

We both needed to replace our rear tires and we ordered Armadillos, which we have found to be effective. I told them I absolutely needed to have the tires within a certain, ample timeframe because we would be leaving town. They said it would not be a problem. I even made that timeframe conservative. When I contacted them a couple days after the deadline, they still did not have the tires. We needed the tires, so we decided to go way out of our way to pick them up when my mother would be visiting the following week and we would have a rental car. 

When we showed up to get them, it turns out they had ordered the wrong tire for my wife's bike. They got the Flak Jacket instead! We were in a bind though because we were out of time and her tire was in serious need of changing, so we had to take it. This tire may be legit for commuting around town, but our field testing has shown it to be pretty useless for touring. A thousand miles later and we have gotten several flats on this one, but none on the remaining Armadillo that has over 4,000 miles on it. We do not buy expensive wheels that are difficult to remove just to have to change flats all the time anyway.

I remember living in LA and waiting in line for hours just for a $2 ice cream sandwich. So I was super excited when I heard about this new place in Downtown Summerlin. That excitement, however, quickly diminished. Call me crazy, but there's really nothing special about CREAM.

Hubby & I came here one afternoon for something sweet to snack on. The place itself is very open and clean. I like how simple it is to order: Pick a cookie, ice cream flavor, and optional toppings, and you're all set! I went with White Chocolate Macadamia Nut cookies paired with Banana Walnut ice cream. The cookies are freshly baked and come straight out of the oven. Warm cookies and cold ice cream sounded like such a good combination, but by the time we made it to our seat, our sandwiches were falling apart! I was getting ice cream everywhere with each bite of the sandwich.

Although the ice cream flavor itself was good, I was having a hard time enjoying the sandwich. Not only was the cookie hard, but I'm not a fan of messy food. Like, at all. At a certain point, I'll just try to finish the food as fast as possible so I can go wash my hands. That was the case here at CREAM. I do feel bad leaving melted ice cream all over the table. Perhaps we got unlucky with the ice cream or the cookies or the chemistry behind pairing the two. Whatever the case may be, Hubby and I both agreed that we have yet to find a decent ice cream cookie sandwich here in Vegas.",2,oQ0m7zCcppNT-8jMbPC6DQ

I've been getting my fades done by Chris since he was an apprentice barber at Crow's Nest, charging only $15 a cut. Probably since 2010. I used to get my hair cut once a week, cause I like to stay looking fresh. So Chris has cut my hair literally hundreds of times. Every haircut has been exacting and perfect, he genuinely takes the time to ensure it's so. I'll think I'm done and be trying to get up, and he'll be touching up this side and that part, grabbing his clippers to fix some tiny imperfection no one else would ever have noticed. The guy genuinely cares about his craft, and it shows in his work.

More importantly than that, he's a stand up, humble guy. After ending his apprenticeship at Crow's Nest, and moving to a full barber, charging full barber prices, he kept me at the original price, for YEARS after. He refused to change the price I paid, and even when I offered he wouldn't accept more money. A lot of business owners are ""customer service"" friendly, like on the surface, but Chris actually backs it up. He understands, just naturally as a facet of his personality, that long term customer relationships are more valuable than an extra $10 in his pocket today, which is a rare trait.

In 2012, I left Toronto and moved to California, then moved back two years later. I went to Crow's Nest, and found out Chris wasn't working there anymore and had opened up his own spot. So I went over there for a cut. During my first cut, I mentioned how I was looking for work. Chris referred me to a friend of his who was hiring, and gave me his email. I emailed him, we met up, and I've been working for his company for the past 7 months. So Chris helped me get a job.

THEN as if that wasn't enough, when I told him I got the job, he told me I couldn't pay for my haircuts anymore because I was working for his friend's company. I don't even know if I should publicize this cause y'all will go in expecting to leave with jobs and free haircuts. I've referred everyone I know there. My nephew and brother in law now get their hair cut by Chris too, and that's a strong endorsement because my sister is serious about her son's haircuts.

So if you're not getting your haircut at Town Barber, you should be.",2,fB25XsOlCtr__jxYtEDKTA

aD2Jg7z1fbCPZAfMpSjxCA,4,2016-05-31,2,j0ZNmQtEuiFlKGXgHTZd0g,0.0,"Highland Yard is a ""Pop-Up"" used goods mercantile selling merchandise that has been repurposed, refreshed and reimagined by pickers, designers and artists into home d√©cor and home and garden furnishings in the latest, trendy styles and color palettes.  It is called a ""Pop-Up"" because it does not follow a 'regular' schedule or 'normal' business hours: it is only open four days a month. 

There is a theme to the merchandise, decor and setup that the designers follow each time they are open.  For instance, 'Road Trip' and 'Endless Summer' have been the first two themes.  Yet, I would classify the overall theme and style of Highland Yard as one of Shabby Chic/French Country Cottage with some Vintage and Mid-Century styles thrown in.  Alas, there is an occasional retro vintage piece or bona fide antique thrown in that could have migrated in from the sister building, Merchant Square, that adds a bit of flair to each vignette.

I visited; saw a few items that I liked, and returned a few days later, only to find that they were closed until next month.  The concept of a pop-up business is certainly fun and unique, and getting dozens of vendors to collaborate on a central theme, setup merchandise and make it marketable to sell to the public is not an easy feat.  I can understand only being open a few days of the month to allow time for a change of venue, however only being open 13% of the month does not allow for much shopping time, nor does it allow access for the uninformed spontaneous shopper passing by.  Perhaps more shopping days would be an improvement.  A pop-up requires informed visitors through interactive, friendly staff, having easy access and detailed signage throughout to create an informed following, all of which was lost on my fellow shoppers and me on two visits.

All in all, I like the idea of a rotating or changing theme and merchandise that is fresh and different; I think it is important to keep a shopping experience novel and I like the excitement that a pop-up brings, but I do feel as though there is an aura of excitement and friendliness that is missing from the staff . . .  especially given this only happens four days a month.  Also absent is a sense of pride from the business or management.  I'm not certain where this sense of pride should emanate from, but it is evident with the absence of friendly, excited staff and a tidy, clean and accessible entrance.  Improving in these customer service areas would certainly align itself with the quality of the furnishings within. 

It is worth a stop if it happens to be one those coveted days that The Yard is open.  If you enjoy this style of d√©cor, you will probably find an item of interest making it worth your while to stop in.  Perhaps in a few months, when some of the newness wears off, I will return and visit again . . . let's just hope I choose the correct four days to do so.

I used to love this place, and it saddens me to have to write a semi-poor review. 

They do have good pastas and pizzas, once they had a ""Seafood Pizza"" which was on a special menu, that was absolutely incredible.

Now as for my recent negative experience. We were there for a friends birthday, and my sister ordered a pizza with Gorgonzola cheese. Once the pizza arrived at the table, a gross smelling odour filled the air. Hesitant to even take a bite of her pizza, she finally did, and believe it or not the pizza tasted as foul as it smelled. 

She called the waiter over, and explained the situation, and his response was ""that's how Gorgonzola cheese smells."" Clearly this is no proper way to handle a situation of the sort. When she asked to speak to the manager (who I believe is also the owner) he pretty much had the same response and did not offer to swap the pizza for another one. Unacceptable.

Luckily amongst the 5 of us, there was plenty of pizza and pasta to go around, but this experience has left me outraged. The pizza sat at the table for the duration of the meal, without anyone touching it. No compensation offered.

Not gonna lie, in time I will probably return since the food is really good, and it's a fun spot to eat at. But a brush up on proper customer service is definitely needed here.",3,k0hZPaZjS1y8A-gxGjWsQQ

Containers:
I usually get the discounted ones. Products are pretty good. BUT someone can't count in their packaging dept. They always give you less than what is specified. I am always missing a cap or something. They would not resend the missing ones to you.

Customer service: 
Really bad. They don't resend missing pieces or bad products. They also aren't knowledgeable about the products they sell. I got quite a few rude ones. 

Butters:
I bought cocoa butter 6/2010. Expiration on it says 6/2011. It actually went rancid by 4/2011. Cocoa butters is very stable and will keep for about five years and resist going rancid. They were probably selling old butters for super high prices.

We went on a Sunday, but saw the advertising for it. 

The bartender, Amber, was very pleasant. She was very attentive and talkative. We didn't sit with an empty cup once throughout our visit. She recommended the Guinness Steak & Mushroom Pie and it was so delicious. It's an in-house made pie that is golden brown and is so flaky, stuffed with saucy button mushrooms and beautiful fall-apart, large chunks of beef. The pie is on top of a generous pile of mashed potatoes and gravy. Best pie I've ever had. My boyfriend ate a good portion of my plate and loved it, and he hates mushrooms. He ordered the Blarney Fries, which is crispy lattice fries smothered in a tasty ""kick'd up ale"" cheese sauce, diced tomatoes, green onions and jalape√±os.

JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,1,2015-10-29,1,Snkhdq9J3IVyUH-eDp1GMw,0.0,"I tend to avoid the big flashy restaurants... especially in the ones in the downtown core. Part of me is always leery. When your main clientele is tourists and the business crowd - simply by location alone - there is a good chance that the food is not necessarily up to par with the cost associated to the meal. Now, I am always willing to be proven wrong so when I had a chance to try Bier Markt for the first time recently, I went in with an open mind.

For the uninformed, Bier Markt is a Toronto chain of restaurants that came to Montreal and took over the old Queue de Cheval location in front of the Bell Centre. Bier Markt's claim to fame is the ridiculous amount of beers they have available - over 150 beers from 30 different countries. The selection is extremely varied and quite good. The beer menu is nicely elaborate. It does a great job of categorizing and describing each beer to help with selection. The prices vary widely though which is a bit strange. I also appreciated that the food menu provides recommendations with pairing for each dish. For a restaurant like this, that detail is essential and provides a nice way to try new beers.

Foodwise, the menu is a mixture of beer garden and classic bar/pub fare. My friends and I went for three starters initially. First up was the French onion soup au gratin with caramelized onions, house veal stock, toasted bread and Gruy√®re cheese. Personally I did not try it but the response from my friends was good - not great.

Next was the baked Brie with Granny Smith apples, lingonberry jam, roasted pecans, pickles and baguette crisps. The jam was nice but once again, overall the dish was good, not great. The portion size was only not that great considering its cost either.

The final entree was the baked crab dip - wild Canadian rock crab, white cheddar, cream cheese, Old Bay spices and toasted house flatbread. This was a more interesting and well done dish. Very creamy with nice pieces of meaty crab within. Main issue once again though was the size relative to the price. Very limited amount of flatbread and frankly, this appetizer was barely sufficient for me much less as a dish to share - which at its price point, it needs to be.

Prior to the description of the mains, I will just take a moment to discuss the service. Now, for the most part, I am pretty relaxed about service in general - I simply want timely, friendly with a good handle of the menu. However, there are a few things that are BIG no-nos for me. One of them is very simple - you should never serve the next course without clearing the table first. During our meal, not only was that done but that was after all the empty dishes were left in front of us for about 20 minutes before serving. On top of that, the waitresses serving our table had no clue who had which main so the second course became a awkward and complicated dance of simultaneously removing, moving temporary around and serving dishes. And then, the same thing was repeated at dessert time later on! With the number of waitresses working around us, these were big red flags about the quality of service.

Back to the food now. The first main was the Merchant burger - 10 oz. Wagyu beef burger, smoked bacon, charred red onion, vine-ripe tomato, iceberg lettuce, ""Bier 58"" sauce, toasted bun with house frites. A good sized burger - a little overcooked for my liking but still flavourful. A solid burger but again for its price, more was hoped for.

I personally went with the Chicken ABT - fresh chargrilled chicken breast, avocado, crisp smoked bacon, vine-ripe tomato, shaved iceberg lettuce and honey Dijon aioli in a Portuguese roll served with fries. The sandwich was good but somehow left me underwhelmed and wishing I had ordering something else. Some extra aioli and avocado may have helped to provide more kick but otherwise I felt the sandwich lacked pop. The fries were nice and crisp at least - very classic bistro style.

The final main was the smoked pork back ribs which are spice-rubbed and smoked for 6 hours, served with a golden BBQ sauce, fries and a red cabbage & caraway slaw. The ribs were nice and tender but because the sauce needed to be added by the client, they were a little dry. The BBQ sauce was a necessity to add, not a choice.

The final dish we ordered was the waffle ice cream sandwich - house-baked chocolate waffles served warm with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. Best thing we had all night - creative, chocolatey and rich. Always nice to end a meal on a positive.

In the end, Bier Markt left me cold. The beer selection was nice and varied - definitely the draw to coming back. However, the food was uninspiring and simply okay. The service was poor. Okay food can be acceptable at certain times but not when my personal bill was 80$ without tip. At that price, there are a heck of a lot better options I can enjoy. Bier Markt is a great happy hour spot for excellent beer but not a worthwhile dining option.

Cheers!",1,xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw

I was walking around the area looking for coffee and am usually super weary of ""hipster"" coffee joints that charge exorbitant prices for terrible coffee and a pissy attitude. 
However I saw the menu on the window and the breakfast croissant meal really caught my eye. The prices looked very reasonable for a variety of brunch goodies. 

I went inside and proceeded to wait...and wait...and wait...luckily I wasn't in a hurry but come on! There were only 3 people ahead of me and no joke I waited over 20 minutes. 

There was only one guy doing everything! He was kind, professional, and didn't seem frazzled but how is one person supposed to take orders, make change, make the drinks, prepare the food, and serve tables? I hope they were just shortstaffed that day. 

Anyway, I FINALLY ordered and the employee put my sandwich on the grill. It was premade which was kind of disappointing but at least it was cheap and big. Coffee was meh. Not the worst. Not good. My cup was very cute though! Oh when I went to pay the guy kinda looked up at me strangely from behind their ""square"" system thing and told me he would have to go downstairs for cash...what?! Who doesn't have cash?! I know I'm a millennial but come on! 
So yes, I waited again. Finally got my coffee and croissant. Way too much room in the coffee but oh well, I couldn't wait around again to ask for more. Croissant was large and I was starving. It was very very greasy but I like that. Give me all the butter please. Overall, I would go back because the food was cheap and while they were understaffed the employee was really nice and didn't act all frazzled and stressed or rude and annoyed. Just don't go if you have limited timing and can't spend 30minutes or more. 

Oh! one thing was weird! a pastry chef girl would occasionally emerge from the back and drop things off. She made NO facial expressions and didn't even clock the large group of people waiting. Maybe it's not her job to help but it seemed super weird not to even comment on the situation or acknowledge her co-worker. Maybe she was a robot.",0,ZMP8fRHf-Br2wgAoqQhVUQ

We also had their Fideo pasta special - with  shrimp, summer vegetables, soffrito 'sauce' and aioli. It was delicious - except that the shrimp were a tad overcooked (sorry Chef!). They could have stood to be cooked about a minute or two less than they were (or maybe it was a heat lamp issue).

Unlike others, I actually thought the tacos were pretty good. But on this busy Sunday, everything else was unpleasant. Other than the view, there is absolutely no reason to visit this place, unless you have a fetish for outdoor Jenga and lousy service. And you can find views just as good as this in Cleveland where your experience will actually be pleasurable.

This was our second time visiting here, and both times were unpleasant. On this visit:

1. The outdoor hostess greeted us with contempt. She may as well have said, ""Oh. You."" when she took our name. A smile and a hello seemed a foreign concept to her.

2. Since there was a wait, we sat at the bar. We may as well have been ghosts. The bartender looked past us three times while he waited on other patrons who it seemed were his old pals from high school. Finally, another bartender came and helped. Good, right? Wrong...

3.  I got the house margarita, and I think it may have been the only time in my life that I sent a drink back. It was like drinking salted lime water. I had both my wife and friend taste it to make sure I wasn't crazy, but they concurred: It was nothing short of awful. 

4.  Our server was kind, but she seemed to really be struggling. I am not sure if this was her fault or the inept and unfriendly bar, but it took us over 20 minutes to get our drinks. In fact, our appetizers came out before our drinks! And when the apps did arrive, we were missing our guacamole. In fact, our main entrees arrived before our guacamole...which arrived before we had more chips with which to eat them. And so on...

Nothing is all bad. The tacos were actually pretty tasty. Paying our bill was quick. But I found the whole experience condescending. What I mean by that is that Coastal Taco seems to exist on the premise that, because of their prime riverfront location, the employees don't have to do anything other than show up and act surly, as if we should be thrilled that we graced them with our presence. No, that is not the way it is supposed to work.

Stephanie was my stylist and she was great. She answered all of my questions and was very pleasant. Unlike another reviewer, I actually liked that we didn't talk the entire time. It's nice to zone out and play on your phone while someone is working away on your hair. 

I took off one star for two reasons.

1) During the hairwashing process, I was presented with which colours I wanted (from a big book). It was super uncomfortable to raise my head halfway during this, while someone else was washing my hair. I actually had a sore neck the next day from straining it. 

2) The chair where you get your hair washed and the chair where you sit while your hair is being coloured are not comfortable. Defs recommend they invest in some cushions or longer chairs so your legs can stretch out more. 

I will definitely be coming back because my hair looks amazing and this place was awesome. That being said, a few things still could be improved upon.",2,zopuXHE12sjKeSukIv6Axg

The diagnostics were kinda pricy BUT the cost is applied towards your repair if you decide to go forward with any repairs.

I dropped off my vehicle late Friday about 4:30 and was promised a visual inspection and call back if diagnostics were needed: that did not happen, which concerned me. :^\

When I came in Saturday morning, my car was in the bay being looked at. I had only signed and authorized for a visual inspection but they had done some electrical diagnostics which I don't think they would have charged me for. :^)

I don't know everything about car repair but I can tell most of the time if I am being B.S.ed. 

They recommended about four repairs to fix one problem.

One repair they recommended I know was needed but I feel weren't necessary. In other words, I have been driving with this condition for some time (three years) and was told by another shop that the repair could be put off for a while but the condition should be repaired soon (that was just two months ago). 

Don't get me wrong: it is not like Meineke was doing wrong or even acting in bad faith: it was one shops opinion versus another's (along with my my previous research into the issue) that made me feel that the one repair could be put off for a while.   

It's hard to believe that the issue had contributed to my cars driveability  but I needed to get it done sooner or later so I opted to get it done that day because the cost was VERY FAIR AND REASONABLE AND I BELIEVED THE SHOP WAS ACTING IN GOOD FAITH.

They did recommend a spark plug change (as that could have contributed to my issue) but if they had actually checked the plugs, they would have seen that they were fine and recently changed.

I just got the car back and did not check the invoice yet but I will update this review in a few weeks and give more feed back as the car's OBD calibrates.

1/1/16 Update:

No problems with the repair and satisfied with the service: I have not had any more issues with my car so I have not been back which is VERY GOOD!

I would recommend this place to a friend for sure!",2,sev8XAmqrsQeCVZUMk693w

I have fairly high expectations for Chicken and Waffles having eaten at some of America's finest like Roscoe's and Gussie's, so I came in here expecting a lot.

I want to start off by saying the place looked dope!  I felt like I was in a store selling high end kicks or a hip hop clothing store in NYC.  I was really feeling the way the kitchen looked along with the seating area.  Man, even the little hooks to hang your bag on the tables made my girl get all giddy and excited.

The prices are very reasonable and the menu is pretty extensive.  I would prefer more options for Chicken and Waffles though, as those seemed limited for some reason.  Like what if I wanted 1 piece bone in and half a waffle cuz I just drank a 40oz and feel a bit bloated knowmsayin?

Overall the service was aight and it did take a mighty minute to get my meal (waited about 15-20 mins for my triple bone in and waffle).  The taste though was on point, my chicken was as crispy as your toes hitting the sand on a hot summers day.  The syrup they have on the table, is some high end business too.  Dat waffle tho, could use a bit more crunch too it.  As soon as I hit it with some Maple Sizzurp, that thing got mad soggy 0-100 real quick.  All good, I ate it up anyway!",11,mFwRTTDW0Yr-rFkTF2cFsw

No update. I asked 10 min later and she said ""what'd you order again"" seriously?!? I repeated my order and she said Oh here it is it just came out. It was my Katsu and beef and she said that's it. I said NO I'm still waiting for my shrimp. The cooks in back looked like they had no idea about it. And told me they were just waiting for my katsu to be done. I showed them the plate like It's right here..... .... suddenly they had a plate of shrimp there for who knows how long sitting there and said ""oh are you table 6??"" Like YES I am actually.

I had bought shoes as a Christmas gift and they were too narrow for my boyfriend to fit in them. So I brought them back hoping he could have them exchanged for another shoe he liked. Well it turns out size 10 is very popular and there was NO shoe he wanted available in his size in store or online. Hes not extremely picky either so he asked for about 6 different shoes and no luck. We couldnt even get them from other stores! So we asked Emma if we could just get store credit to spend it later when we find something else we like and she said no. We were 10 days past the return/exchange policy and apparently we were lucky she even considered letting us exchange them in the first place! I let her know that we would literally be throwing our money away if we exchanged the shoes for a pair he didnt even want and she said shes sorry but we need to think of this from the COMPANY'S point of view: ""We cant just let anyone come in 4 months later off the street to return shoes because we dont know what happened to them."" 
I was like, wait, what??? First of all, we're not from the street. We're customers who have a legit receipt and the COMPANY doesnt have any shoes he wants in his size. The shoes Im returning are WHITE all around so you can see theyre in perfect condition. 
She kept repeating the same thing and i was so fed up I called the corporate office. They apologized for her because obviously policies are just guidelines and even though she had the power to give us store credit, she didnt, and thus will require more training on what the COMPANY actually requires of her. 

We're so done with this store. We went to the Foot Locker at AZ Mills and told them what happened and the manager there gave us store credit and said this isnt the first time its happened.

Prices are really cheap.  If you go at lunchtime you can get a combo with a ""freshman"" sub, side (chips, macaroni salad or pickle spears) and a soda for $5.50!!! OMG, that's super cheap to me.  And the freshman is really quite large and stuffed with meat.  I don't think I could have eaten any larger of a size.

I tried the steak and cheese (no cheese, no onions -- the onions are raw, not cooked, so: No. Thank. You. to them.)  The sub was great.  Hot, fresh, tasty -- and that was just the guy behind the counter! (rim shot!) No seriously it was very good and just what I was in the mood for.  Of course if I had been normal and gotten the cheese it would have been even better and stayed together.  But I don't like cheese all the time and it don't like me! (lactose intolerant)

The macaroni salad did waylay me with an unexpected bite of fresh, raw onion -- bleh!  Almost ruined my taste buds for my sub.  Personally I would steer clear of it in the future, even though it was very fresh and otherwise tasty.

Other than that, great cheap meal on a cold night.  The dining room is pleasant and a lot more clean and comfortable than a lot of sub joints I have seen around.

They don't skimp on the meat either, which some places tend to do.  I've been to Vietnamese restaurants all over the valley, and although I have still never been to Da Vang...I'd venture to say this might be the best pho in Phoenix.

Hint #2: This is a Korean restaurant, meaning the food is Korean spicy. If you don't like spicy, do not get the tteokkboki or the spicy chicken. If things are really spicy for you, you can cool off your mouth with rice, pickled radish or iced tea.
Hint #3: If you get the bibimbap, PLEASE, mix it all together and add gochujang sauce to your desired spicy level. You can always add more sauce on your own plate.

We had a great experience - we were seated quickly, we got our food fairly quickly, everything was hot (temp wise) and our drinks were refilled before we asked. We did go after 3 on a Sunday, though. And the food, the food was SO GOOD!

This is our top pick for house cleaning services in Las Vegas. They are thorough, dependable, and have successfully served the Las Vegas Valley since 1991. Even more, they use only safe and green products.

I've lived here two years and tried six different businesses. I've also heard plenty of horror stories from longtime residents. Don't be fooled by dirt cheap cleaning services; you get what you pay for. Some places rush over things, some places break things, some places take things. Some use strong-smelling, toxic chemicals that leave your place smelling like a grim hospital ward. Other places go through employees like air traffic controllers.  Once I was informed by a cleaning office that two experienced women would be arriving at 2pm sharp. At 2:25pm two guys approximately 18 and 19 roll up in a raggedy gangster car with no hubcaps and cracked rear window. They walk in, pants pulled down showing their boxers, carrying a cheap old vacuum with dangling cord. I say ""Sorry guys, not happening.""

Then one day I notice a shiny, practical, white hatchback parked across the street loaded with a variety of cleaning supplies. The car windows display a house cleaning advertisement/logo. Soon three industrious-looking women come bustling out my neighbor's apartment door, carrying vacuums and mops. I ask them for a flyer which they hand me with a smile.

Next week they clean my 2 bedroom apartment. Before they arrive, Cindy, a co-owner and manager, gives me a courteousy call to check in. The three-women crew does an amazing job. Everything is swept, cleaned, scrubbed, scoured, washed, emptied, dusted, polished, picked up, put away, folded, and now shiny. And get this:  it smells fine, too, light and clear, no crazy chemicals. They use only safe and green products. A few minutes after the girls leave, Cindy calls again, making sure all went well.

I was so impressed I used them again. They did another stellar job.

So I decided Las Vegas Top Picks should have a top pick for housecleaning, too. I asked to meet the owners, Cindy and Bobby. One spring afternoon I visited their office; we sipped peppermint tea and talked house cleaning.

They told me some funny stories of celebrity clients. One individual had a large cougar in his garage, which often sat atop a 100K+ luxury car scratching the bejesus out of it. Since they've been in business for nearly 22 years, they have many such stories! Such a length of time also exemplifies their success and trustworthiness. Bobby, the owner, takes pride in her work and good care of her ""girls"". Their website, which I hope you visit, further demonstrates this. It is comprehensive, professional, personal, and with a big clean heart. They work hard to tailor their cleaning to your precise specifications. In my experience, businesses that truly care about what they do provide the best service.

Also awesome was their giant city map pinned to an office wall. Was I in a secret CIA hub scouting the streets of Las Vegas? Or perhaps they just have tons of customers and know this town like the back of their helping hands.

They even have a mascot - a cute friendly little dog named Bella.  

I believe it's important to find skilled trustworthy businesses whenever spending money, doubly important when they come into your home on an ongoing basis. For house cleaning Your Helping Hands is TOP in this town!

2aoKv8DjAeVBjTT9O9sx5g,1,2014-05-10,6,4C9aeWR-T6DHvevaantGAA,0.0,"While you will initially be drawn to the moderate prices and location right by Planet Hollywood, you will quickly regret that decision.  Not only is their no restaurant in this hotel (they have a pool bar that can microwave a burger from Sysco for you if you are brave), they are going to spend the entire time trying to market to you and get you to buy a timeshare.  I mean the entire time.

I received 3 phone calls every day in the room, and numerous messages.  And if you don't respond to those messages and delete them, they will remind you at the front desk that you have the messages.  Then, they sell your email address to their partners, who will put together countless emails to send to you that look like they were designed by a fifth grader who just learned that color text and font sizes are a thing.  I am surprised that the Marriott brand allows such tasteless emails to be sent out to its guests - not for the promotion, I know everybody needs to make a buck here and there - but for the sheer lack of quality in the emails from this person Kacee.  Fuzzy picture of the hotel's logo at the top, obviously a screen grab, highlighted text, numerous font sizes and colors.  Just hack.

Anyways, back to the hotel - you get a spacious room, each is what they call a 'villa'.  Thought the term is misused, you can think of it as a large space, with three rooms (a sitting space with TV and a small, tasteful kitchen, a bedroom, and a bathroom) in the one-bedroom version.  The cost is reasonable for what is included, though since it is not attached to any of the casinos or anything like that, you will be wanting to spend your time elsewhere (less you have to deal with all the promotions and endless phone messages).  

The hotel lies across the street from PH casino and resort, which is a nice example of the LV strip.  You of course have to trudge through an underground parking garage for about a 1/4 mile to get to the casino through a back entrance (watch out for delivery and trash trucks making the rounds down there, almost got hit!)  There are some great little restaurants, some tackier cheap restaurants, and a shopping mall that I did not wander in to but I heard was nice.  Played a little blackjack, lost some money, had some drinks - all in all a good time (at PH...)

So in summation - it sucks that this is a timeshare property, will absolutely not be coming back here again.  The sales and marketing on site are relentless, and though I am not going to pretend they are high and holy, I am surprised that Marriott is okay with its brand getting tainted by hacker-y such as this.  Now my email has been sold to some crap company, so I have that to look forward to.  

I stay in Marriott's around the country, about 100+ days a year for work and play, and this was by far the most annoying.  But if you don't have an email account, rip your room phone our of the wall, and don't interact with any of the staff on your way out the door to more interesting places on the strip, you will have a great time and save a little money!  Good luck!",15,xpuH_j4EmgmvvUlLRfD4JQ

My BF when he goes in, only goes to one particular lady. Because he trusts her with his hair, which he is really picky when it comes to his hair being cut. I would say about 99% people that come into this place usually goes in waiting for a particular barber and no one else. They will wait hours if they have for their barber to be done before they are up. 

The place is always filled with customers. Never have I seen an empty shop when I'm there.

e) pitcher of beer

or 

g) all of the above?

If you guessed g) then you would be right.  (The fact that I had to get down to g) should show you the type of place this is...)  A group of us from the office went to lunch (8 of us) and the waitress just couldn't seem to get anything right.  

We were pleasant, waited patiently for everything, even ate our order of wings anticipating that our appetizers were going to be coming soon!   After about 5 minutes after finishing our wings we reminded our waitress about our appetizers...which were then brought out 10 minutes after that.  I guess when they couldn't get a drink order correct we should have just stopped there.  

Now onto their ""food"".  (Note the quotes as I wouldn't make anyone eat here again...ever.)  

The nachos.  Ugh.  I don't know about you but I consider the use of that nacho cheese ""sauce"" to be disgusting and never to be used.  The nachos were obviously put together with little thought and was doused with the cheese sauce with some shredded cheese on top to cover it.  (Think of the shredded cheese as a ""toupee"" for the garbage that it is hiding underneath it.)  

The wings are average, (the hot and honey is actually a really good combination of spicy and sweet) but its their dill dipping sauce that make them a bit more palatable.  Or in this case, less-average.

The building and interior locals very modern and quiet in place with Scottsdale; I really like the look of this place. 

The 3 beers they have are the IPA, Saison & Wesern Lager. The Lager i was not too impressed by; it's maltier then expected, much like a Marzen. The IPA is not very hoppy but flavorful, reminds me of Deschutes Mirror Pond. The Saison is in my opinion their best and is bottled and avaible outside the taproom, so try it out.

It used to be that if the provider applied a few sprays of liquid nitrogen to treat something on your skin (very common in dermatology practices), you were charged reasonably, and for very tiny blemishes you might even get a courtesy spritz or two.  That has changed. Now, the last time I received liquid nitrogen spray to treat a small keratosis (brownish nuisance growth), the cost was $168. To me, this is excessive and gouge pricing for a few spritzes of nitrogen spray.   The doctors and staff there are fine, but their pricing has escalated such that I feel the costs to get dermatology treatment there is now unreasonable and I will seek another dermatology office.  Also, don't bother to get there early, and take along a book, because the wait time to get seen after checking in can get quite lengthy these days.

Edit after their copy/paste blah, blah reply:   You didn't even address my primary complaint about your practice....gouge pricing for simple and cheap application of nitrogen spray.  It takes usually a portion of a minute to spray that on and you buy it VERY cheap, yet now you charge big $$$ for a few sprays from your nitrogen canister/sprayer.  Talk about a profit margin. But to try to be understanding of Affiliated Dermatology's position on this:  all those new Porsches every year get expensive....those big bucks have to come from somewhere.

7ibuDLfx8gEhESAufYIySw,0,2011-01-20,0,36LRjPqfA9WvXEFvIsHlhA,0.0,"Every time anyone asks about sushi or wants to know where to get good sushi, I always refer them to Sushimon. 

Now, don't get me wrong, this place is not perfect. However having tried more than a few spots in town, and seen the many gimmicks put up by other places, Sushimon remains my favorite sushi spot. 

All the negatives that people mention about this place are technically  true

- This place is not close to the strip.
- The wait time can be long(sometimes topping out at 1 hour +
- The restaurant is smallish.

However, if you're visiting Vegas, and really want good sushi, is it  that horrible to drive an extra 10 minutes to not have to deal with casino parking, not have to walk a mile and a half to get to the place, and not deal with the absurd prices you often find at restaurants on the strip?

I've often found, that any restaurant, be it big or small that can produce a full house and wait, is doing something right.

Sushimon doesn't offer you fine dining service. It's not going to blow you away with it's superior service.

I don't know about you guys, but I really don't think that matters.

If you're getting AYCE Sushi, you already have an idea of what kind of sushi you want, and what your preference is.

All the server's I've seen at Sushimon are good at getting the food out, and keeping the drinks full.

You could go to some dirty place in the middle of a bad neighborhood and get Sushi for $4-5 cheaper, sure.

But Sushimon offers almost their entire menu on their AYCE and All-you-can-eat Dessert as well. 

I know a lot of places mark off menu items and only offer you one dessert.

Things I LOVE from Sushimon

Nigiri:
- Hamachi (Yellowtail)
- Salmon
- Super White Tuna
- Unagi

Other offerings:
- Hamachi Collar(most places don't offer this, and they sometimes run out, but if they have, order it!)
- Salmon Collar
-All the rolls(and 1/2 rolls for almost all of them if you want to try the roll without getting too full, again something most places don't offer)
-Uni(Sea Urchin) (one per person)
-Ama Ebi(sweet Shrimp) (also one per person)

Dessert(AYCE)
-Mochi Ice Cream (Strawberry/Vanilla)
-Green Tea, Red Bean, and Lychee Ice Cream
- Tempura Ice cream

Sure you could in theory find a cheaper place than this, in a more ""glamorous"" location, but if I'm gonna shell out $20+ for a meal, I don't mind paying a little bit more knowing that my meal is going to be good. Sushimon offers you a large menu to choose from, speedy service, and most importantly, consistency. I've been here at least a dozen times, and haven't once had a bad experience. 

In case anyone is wondering, they DON'T do call ahead seating, so you have to arrive in person to get your party on the list.",2,wWhllrw0Y_Dl5rHEUDUdww

When we first walked in, around 530 in the evening on a Wednesday during an Indians game, there were maybe three other tables occupied in the restaurant. We stood in front of the hostess station while a waitress rolling napkins attempted to avoid our gaze and four other waiters/waitresses walked by us. We stood there for literally...ten minutes until the waitress who was trying to avoid us by folding napkins was told to seat us. 

Perhaps it was our fault for not saying anything? 

No, their service is just really poor, and none of the employees there really care about customer service. 

While I was waiting for someone to notice my boyfriend and I, the ambiance of the restaurant is fairly nice. Dimly lit, a little classier feel to it but nothing remarkable. There is no parking, you have to park in a garage. The bathrooms are weird public bathrooms down the stairs and around the corner, also. 

It was happy hour, and their specials were not communicated anywhere online, nor shown anywhere on the menu... and our waitress did a poor job verbally explaining it. Their signature martinis are not part of happy hour, and ONLY SOME APPETIZERS ARE $4.95. The Chocolate Bar randomly picks week to week, or day to day, or maybe they choose it based on what you order. I'm not really sure.  

As for drinks, I love chocolate-based liquory nonsense drinks. I would really recommend a Chocolate Covered Pretzel Martini, it was really well made, delicious, chocolately, and I couldn't taste the liquor. However, for my second drink I ordered a Nutella Martini, which was legitimately poorly made. It was not simply poured heavily, it did not taste like Nutella and the vodka was extremely apparent. I was really surprised they did not use Frangelico hazelnut liquor, or anything remotely resembling Nutella. I was also surprised that each Martini did not list the types of liquors in each. I personally think that the Hofbrauhaus has much better speciality dessert martinis for $8 (rather than $10 at the chocolate bar)

I did not have dinner, but I ordered a chocolate cake, and I have no complaints with it. It was rich, fudgey, yummy, but nothing I couldn't have gotten somewhere else. I can't remember what it was called, unfortunately.

This shop carries some name brand frames, but this is just something it also does.  It main strength is professional services.  The store owners are a couple who are both licensed opticians.  I usually start from deciding on a pair of frame.  After this, the magic begins.  The optician patiently observes how a frame sits on my face, uses a machine to measure the eye focal points, marks the focal points on lens.  These markings ensure that I can see well when I wear the eyeglasses.  When I pick up the frame, the optician carefully adjusts the nose piece and ear arms to ensure the focal points match my eyes.  I can tell you that you cannot get this level of professional optical services from a salesperson.  They also offer minor after sales services such as readjusting the ear arms, replacing the nose shoes, for free.

The location is extremely beautiful, sits on a sort of man made lake, ducks, paddle boats and tons of cute shops. It was such a beautiful day to sit outside with the sun shinning & perfect weather (finally).

The interesting thing about FT from my experience is I don't believe you have just one waiter/waitress which was a gift/curse. Our initial waiter brought out water and took drink orders. We ordered the Jack Belinni's (I highly recommend) and the Rum Mimosa's which are more on the sweet side. Drinks were made nicely but of course could have been stronger lol but don't we all think that way?

After getting our drinks, it took maybe 20 mins for someone to come back to take our order. We had to ask a waiter that was servicing another table for our waiter and long/behold our new waitress came to take our order. After placing our order of Shrimp & Grits which were so well made & delicious. Think the chef was a bit heavy handed on the cheese but I ate around it still good.

Eventually the bus boy came out and took our plates and yet again we're all looking for our waiter/waitress to order another round of drinks. Eventually someone showed up, took our order for another round which never came out. We literally had to go find our waiter and ask for an update. We were told it wasn't put in by the waitress so again we waited. The entire 2.5hrs we were there we had 2 drinks because of us constantly waiting.

Overall, FT is  stars but I can't over look how they over stretch & extend their wait staff because it causes their service to suffer which is why I put . A recommendation would be to give one server a large table and maybe a smaller one. A customer should never have to ask for their waiter/waitress 3 times.",0,09KPCp9W_NalQga28aPd2Q

What I was not expecting a chipotle style food selection.   We still gave it a shot and realized that the cost for three tacos was the same if you did a burrito or a bowl.   Unfortunately the wife and I picked street tacos which for the price you are better off choosing the burrito or bowl to qualify as a meal.  Three tacos is normally ok, but 2-3 pieces of dried shrimp or scant traces of asada doesn't cut it.   We've had better luck at some of the Mexican food restaurants that serve asada vs, marinated sirloin sitting in a container in its own liquid.  Again this may be deliberate to get people through the food line faster but the atmosphere of this place warrants a table service rather than a quick heating of a cold corn or flour tortilla.   
Hope they improve on the food as the restaurant selections nearby are slim.",1,8--idK3Ni0_YVrlvQjzPpg

The good:
Attention and service from Christopher was outstanding. Drinks were always filled. Very helpful with the menu. Managers also stopped by frequently to check up on us.

The nachos were the best ever! First, they prepare the dish by spreading out the chips in a single layer and putting all the toppings on every chip before baking. Then they pile the chips onto the serving plate. The effect is that every chip has cheese and toppings on it. No blank chips in the middle and bottom. Plus, tons of flavor on the toppings.

Lettuce wraps were fantastic. Served with chicken cooked two different ways and a flavorful sauce. 

The chili was outstanding. Very mild, but served with Sriracha so that you could add heat to your own taste.

The not-so-good:
Food was slow coming out. Obviously a kitchen issue, because at every round, the waiter came by to apologize and say the food would be out soon.

The hamburger was just OK. My son said he would prefer a Red Robin burger.",0,nGx5vw1WJ7y_mmwC-0keDw

Donuts like the way they were meant to be!  

The store front is small and there is not much room to eat there, it's definitely more of a pick up and take home to enjoy kind of place. 

The customer service is average, not great but not bad. I've come so many different times and days and I've never once had any issues like some other people have, maybe they just didn't like the attitude of certain customers and they are selective to who the sell to?

Forget all the issues you have to contend with at the Core Institute, from getting a timely appointment to, after waiting weeks, waiting some more as they fail miracuously at making you wait up to 90 minutes AFTER your scheduled appointment time.

Then, if you need surgery, I hope you like to wait some more as your condition worsens to the point that surgery no longer is effective.

The Core Institute does not respect the value of their clienteles time. They book as many as possible to make as much money as possible, all at your expense of money and time.

I went with a rather large group of people here for lunch to try their summerlicious menu. We were very excited to go because their menu looked simple but good. We walked in and immediately loved the decor and the vibe of the place. We were eventually given water and placed our drink orders. 
Most people at our table had the calamari as an appetizer and I have to admit, it was pretty good. Another one of my friends had the salad which she said was yummy and the presentation of it was lovely. The only iffy thing that happened during this course was that someone requested some lemon to use with their calamari and the waitress brought it to her in a dirty glass. 
The main course was where everything started to really go downhill. 
Part 1: The Burger
The majority of us ordered the burger. One person specifically asked if the burger came with any type of sauce on it and he was told by the waiter that no, it didn't. So he continued to order his burger with just cheese, lettuce and tomato on it. When he finally got his burger it had everything on it including some type of mayonnaise/sauce. He then asked our waiter to switch it as he was told that the burger was not supposed to come with sauce. The waiter took it back and then brought back another with pickles and onions on it, no cheese and no sauce. We asked the waiter to take it back again as the only thing that he wanted was a burger with lettuce, cheese, and tomatoes. The burger came back again, but this time we noticed that even though there was no sauce on the bun, the kitchen had replaced one of the old burger patties with sauce and stuck it on the burger. Confused yet? We called for the manager at this point and explained what happened and after 4 tries, the kitchen or our waiter, got it right. I've never seen anyone have to work so hard for a simple burger.
Part 2: The salmon. 
Another person in our group ordered the salmon. It was raw. We also had to call the manager for this one and she was given another ""well done.""
Dessert was interesting. People said that the tiramisu was actually good. I'd believe it, it looked good. Half of us ordered the very questionable creme brulee. I say questionable only because it was a very very cold custard with what looked like an attempt to fire the top but then fell flat because after they fired the top, they put it back in the fridge so it in essence became custard with a soggy really sweet top. It wasn't horrible but it certainly wasn't creme brulee.
After all that, you'd think that the restaurant would have at least comped the cheque for the guy who had to try 4 times to get a very simple burger, and comp the girl who's salmon was raw. But no, that was a fight as well. In the end, one of them paid their bill and the other fought a long and hard battle and finally got his meal comped. 
What started out as a great place turned out horrible. I definitely don't recommend eating there.",4,YkXZhuecZl-OlR6_d8d-Tw

I tried to make reservations on OpenTable for a party of 7, but the max you can do is 6.  So, I called the hostess and requested a table for 7 people at 9pm on Sat.  When we arrived, we were escorted into a private back room (where they store the wine).  The ambiance of the room was fantastic!

At the table, we had the following dishes that I found particularly memorable and delicious:
Gilled Octopus - Best octopus I've ever had
Bucatini 'all'Amatriciana' - This was so good that I got it again at Enoteca San Marco (Batali's other restaurant in the Venetian) 2 days later.  The pasta noodles are nicely al dente.
Jose's Pyramids - We got this as an appetizer.  Delicious!
Steak ""Tagliata"" - The gem butter lettuce accompaniment was really good.  The steak comes sliced (so it's best to order it a bit rarer than you normally would) and is encrusted with delicious peppery-salty goodness.
Harry's Berries Strawberries

Warm Lamb's Tongue
Goat Cheese Tortelloni

Convenience. You don't have to walk a mile through a crowded casino to the guest elevators because there is no casino! Easy, short walk to the elevators and in your room you go. LIFESAVER if you're a girl in heels and think you might never feel your toes ever again at the end of a long night. 

Kitchenette. A MICROWAVE! Sure, the fridge is tiny and barely cools a drink let alone keep your food at a safe temperature, but it's something. When you have leftovers, it's great to come back in the early morning of partying and just pop it in the microwave and be able to eat in 1 minute time. There's a stove too.. you can request for cooking tools and plates/bowls/etc. 

Room Size and Amenities. This is for the regular room- there's the kitchen area with dining table, a living room with a pull out bed/couch, a queen bed, and a full bathroom with shower and bath. Large windows to enjoy the view. Two televisions! Plus, everything's modern with the touch of Vegas sexy.

Location. To get to Cosmopolitan from Vdara, you exit the hotel and turn left, walk a few feet, go down a flight of stairs, then walk a few more feet and ta-da! you're in front of the Cosmo entrance. Okay. I wish it was closer. But it's not far at all. Actually, we tried to take a taxi from Vdara to Cosmo, and they wouldn't let us. That's how close it is. Aria is just next door too. And there's a tram to Bellagio! 

Rates. Just look it up. Rooms tend to be cheaper than all the other hotels on the strip. Seriously. How? Why? When Vdara is so darn nice!

That's all I can think of for now. I love Vdara and would live here if I could. They do have that option....",1,3JgniU0gPJj73fLdBTb55w

You will not feel intimidated or judged because there are a lot of in shape people here. Frankly, except for the very rare jerk we either do not even notice or care at all what you look like. We all started somewhere, and NO ONE looks down on the 300lb person trying to lose weight, or the skinny kid trying to grow. If you feel judged, it's that you are projecting your own insecurities. On to the review!

I must be getting softer in my old age, as I used to detest this sort of gym. I avoided these nice, shiny, clean, fitness clubs and instead went to divey prison yard type gyms where the ""hardcore lifters"" went. 

Well that preference has changed since switching to Lifetime. After being sick of the lack of maintenance, grimy gym and grimier clientele at Gold's I signed up here and have never looked back. I'll try to be brief since there's many aspects to cover.

Staff: Extremely helpful and pleasant. From the sales staff to the dietician to the cafe people to the janitors every person has greeted me me with a smile and been excellent to deal with. Specifically Travis in sales, and Theresa the dietician have been wonderful.

Facilty/Equipment: Top notch. Well maintained. Clean. A little lacking in free weights compared to the sheer number of machines. Even at peak hours there's enough to go around. Cardio equipment area is the size of most entire gyms.

Clientele: People are friendly and for the most part considerate. I hate to sound elitist, but the fact that this gym is 3 to 5X the cost of Gold's or 24 Hr it serves to weed out the undesirables. There is no women's section because the men aren't creepy and leering so they don't need to hide.

Locker room: CLEAN. Think nice Vegas casino bathroom. No creepy nude men meatgazing all day. Toilets are in their own room, so no foul odors. Separate shower stalls as well. Towels and shampoo/body wash supplied.

Classes: I have not taken any, but my wife loves them. Great instructors, and the classes are on time and not always being switched or cancelled with no notice like at some other gyms. Yoga is included as well, which I intend to try soon. 

Other: Cafe food is excellent. Spa is excellent. One of the best massages I've ever had.",3,6yr9JQHzHXqK8e7Xd4rcVw

Gxu3_yzEAXKtkBB0YpnvlQ,3,2009-07-19,3,cIeF6K2kjNNkJ2pMKrGztA,0.0,"Last weekend I decided to go on a hunt to see if I could find a deal worthy of trading in my current car for a newer model. I went to two dealerships because one I was familiar with and closer to my home, and the other had the exact car I wanted. I should have never made that second trip.

I already put car salesman at a lower bar than other people in my mind, but this was a whole new level of low. If you don't want to end your day wanting to staple things to people's heads, I would stay away from this dealership.

I walked into the dealership knowing what I wanted. I still wanted to browse first, but I had researched. This is also not my first car buying experience, and not my first Mazda. I am well aware of the line. Oh yeah, and I'm also a car fanatic. 

I didn't mind being hunted down by a salesman right away because I had really already knew what I wanted. It was coincidental that without saying what I wanted, the first car he decided to show me was the one I had seen in their online inventory. 

Soon enough I was on a test drive. Great car as expected. I asked some simple questions such as if I could have more details on the specifics of the particular perimeter alarm that was installed on that car to which the salesman did not have an answer. Makes me think it would have been fun to ask him what was under the hood.

We all know that what comes next is the fun part. And by fun, I mean extremely annoying process that takes 10 times longer than it should - the negotiating process. The first part was estimating the trade in value of my car though he decided to wrap this up in the first round of pricing negotiations. Right off the bat I was undercut by a couple grand at least on my trade in. Not cool. 

I told him that the trade in value wasn't acceptable and asked if I could find out the specific price plan I was eligible for to which I received a blank look. I would expect a dealership employee to know the various standard pricing plans. I also let him know I wanted to know what other offers were available. After waiting awhile, he came back with no change in the trade in, but did give me the pricing plan I was eligible for.

Since it was still not where it needed to be, I explained to him what I was looking for. I told him my situation and that I did not need to buy a new car. I told him that my car was perfectly fine and in amazing condition and that I wasn't desperate. I let him know the price I had gotten down to at another dealership and where I ideally wanted to be. I said I didn't want to play negotiation games and I wanted to know how close he could get me.

Things quickly got out of line. I was treated with great disrespect as I was given excuse after excuse and attack after attack. At one point he recommended I lease and when I explained to him I did not want to lease I was given a rant of how I don't put enough miles on my car and it's stupid for me to buy. Really? Okay. I'm out then. If that wasn't enough I was also attacked for asking what the lowest price was. I was asked if I wanted the company to lose money all while he kept informing me that he gets paid on commission, which goes by the number of cars he sells. I guess maybe I looked like I didn't know how car dealerships worked and how the car buying process goes. At one point he asked again where I wanted to be payment wise, to which I told him. He then put a range down on a scrap piece of paper with an x and a line below it and told me to sign. When I said I wasn't comfortable signing a scrap piece of paper below a payment price range without any detail or further information, he became very agitated.

In the end I let him know that this wasn't going anywhere and that I didn't think the price was going to be where I needed it to be. I told him that with the economy the way it is, that I figured the price would be lower. When I purchased my other car in a much better economy I was able to get a better deal. I asked if I could have my pricing plan certificate back and was given a very sarcastic, ""You can have whatever you want.""

I was so repulsed by the way I was treated. I emailed customer service at the dealership and never received a response. I cannot believe they would ignore a situation like this, though with the only other review being a 1, I am not that surprised anymore. 

Slightly more detail is available on my blog, but I didn't want to write a novel here unless it was wanted. Oops I guess I already did :)",6,5V8eXkTJb6IejJkMDaj_Bw

I take my in-laws here for dinner each Christmas, when I cash out some Amex points for gift cards. This is a nice upscale establishment, with an accessible waitstaff and bar crew. Everyone is very friendly and quite knowledgeable about the menu.

The group favorite here is the prix fixe menu, which gets you three courses. The entrees have varied - the last time I was there only one fish option was listed as the entree. (This is odd for a Hawaiian fusion place.) The short ribs I had instead where quite good, however.

The bar crew here is very good, and they make a killer mojito. No beer on tap, though, which is disappointing. (A nice draft Sapporo would go quite well with the fish.)

maybe it was because we were hungry and a little cranky, but it felt like everything from water service to actually taking out order took forever. the food came out in a fairly timely manner, but out server forgot about the patatas bravas we ordered, which my sister was stoked about because they its a traditional spanish tapa.i must say - the busser was awesome! very attentive with the water refills and pre-bussing. she even brought new plates and forks for our dessert!

we ordered:
smoked salmon toasts
shrimp ceviche
tuna tartare
stuffed dates
thai beef salad
manchego mac n cheese
albondigas
chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms
lamb skewers
banana nutella sandwich

the table by the door sucks because the door would hit my chair anytime someone went in or out.

I had grown up with dogs my whole life and had just gotten my first dog on my own and expected everything to run smoothly, as it always did. My husband and I moved into a new house and my dogs behavior began to change. She became aggressive when we were outside together and even cornered me once. I felt like I had no control and was extremely anxious when I was around her, a feeling I never wanted to feel with my dog. I immediately reached out to Nate who spent a few hours with me over text talking through ways to handle the situation until we could meet up. After our first session I couldn't believe how much better I felt around my dog. We worked on simple day to day activities first like walking on a leash, and not having my arm pulled out of it socket, and how to answer the front door with and excited, anxious dog. We then moved on to the bad behaviors outside and ways to correct her. My dog has truly done a 180 thanks to Nate and has even been given compliments on how well behaved she is. I would recommend Nate to anyone especially if they are struggling with a dog, as they are suppose to bring love and excitement into a home not fear and anxiety!

I do not count the lettuce, tomatoes and other stuff. I pay for the gyro, that is the meat, but I do not think I got the amount of meat that means $8 to me. To be honest, I do not know the weight of the meat, but my guess is it was less than 4 oz, probably 2 oz. You need to tell me buddy how much meat you are offering in your wraps and you should obey your own rules.

In my opinion, $6 for that combo (tasteless gyro wrap & tasteless fries) is more than enough, not a deal of the day, of the week, or the month. If you want to call it a deal, add a free 20 oz drink to the combo and offer it for $6. 

I am one of those who misses the tastes offered by Istanbul Grill. Istanbul Grill was offering the similar gyro sandwich & fries even for more: $9. But, I was enjoying fully what I was eating: Their bread, gyro, and even fries, I mean every bite in the package was full with its own flavor and taste. 

It is very clear that the previous chief is not there any longer. Where is that chief now? If anyone knows, please write it here.

If you are flying into Toronto and expecting this car rental to be in the airport, it is not. If you're flying international, you will have to take a shuttle to a different terminal and then call them to be picked up. 
I was aware of the need to be picked up, however I was not aware of needing to find the shuttle and take it to a different terminal.
I was also not aware of the need to have proof of car insurance, otherwise being forced to buy car insurance from them. Interestingly, this policy only applied to me. As I spoke to other unhappy renters, they were not being forced into purchasing insurance. They were however being charged for pre-existing scratches on the car. And had to go through an ordeal of proving it. The service rep didn't even bother pulling up the initial paperwork before abusing the renter of scratching the car. Another story I heard was a renter being charged a $1000 hold, instead of the standard $500. But I guess there is no standard procedure here. Reps do as they please? 
Another irk is getting the car with half a tank and needing to return it the same. I have never heard of a car rental requiring a half a tank of gas upon return. Honestly feels like a scam as well, you'll either overfill for them or come a little bit under and likely get charged for it.

The first time I went in to this place I was blown away , this place is amazing , you can get lost in all the equipment that they have. I was in there looking for a new set of irons. Now it's been bout two years since the last time I played so I was a bit intimidated bout asking for help. I older gentmen came up to me and ask how he can help me. I told him my situation and he was very helpful answered all. My questions and showed me different sets that I might like. Then he let me hit a few with each set and made sure I was happy with the one I decided on. He was very helpful and made me feel excited to play the game again..

So a few days later I decided to come back and buy a new driver and fairway woods just to complete my set. I'm not sure why but I receive the worst customer service I have ever gotten. I was treated like I didn't belong in that store. I was ignored my all of the employees. The gentlemen that helped me the first time was not there so I couldn't go back to him. So I decided to man up and ask for help. I had to flag someone down and when I finally got someones attention , that attitude the employee gave me was atrocious. He made me feel like I was wasting his time.  I told what I was looking for and the answer I got was shocking. When I told him I was looking for a new driver and woods the employee rolled his eyes then just point and the drivers and woods. "" that's a driver , that a driver and those over there are your woods"" then walked away. I was very offended by this. 

I feel like if I went in wearing the same attire ( collar shirt , dress pants and shoes) I would of gotten the same service as the first time a came in to the store.

As it is right now, you can gamble more cheaply here than any casino in Las Vegas.  The $1 craps table alone is worth the drive down to Henderson.  If you are just learning the game, or on a tight budget (i.e., married), this is your place!  Over the last ten years some of my most memorable gambling experiences have happened at this craps table.  Weird, wild stuff.

I rarely play craps anymore. These days I like to play roulette. If you like roulette, this is your place!  The minimum bet is $1, a mere fraction of anywhere else. And they have .10 cent chips, so you can bet like crazy and have all kinds of fun. 

This casino is sort of an on the job training venue for the Boyd gaming company.  The employees are always engaging and helpful.  It is a pleasure to play here. 

Yeah, it's smoky.  Yeah, it's divey. And yeah, it's packed with old geezers.

z_IKNghnlqZWUgkyU9liIw,0,2016-04-14,0,2r14YUMMTKDEIT6dALf63A,0.0,"My wife and little boy went to Healing Hearts around 1:00pm on 4/13/2016 because my son had been throwing up, vomiting, and had a high fever (son is almost 2 years old).  My wife was not received by a doctor, but by Sonia the Nurse Practitioner and she diagnosed my son with having an ear infection. 

Sonia asked my wife which pharmacy she preferred, my wife told her the Walgreens on Alma School and Guadalupe.  Before leaving, my wife asked for the prescription and the nurse said that they would call and order it in and to not worry about it, that they would get it taken care of.  

Around 4:45pm that same day, my wife didn't hear anything from Walgreens so she called the pharmacy and they said that nothing had been ordered yet.  My wife, knowing that Healing Hearts would close quickly, called them and they said that it had been ordered at the Walgreens on Dobson and Warner.  My wife told them No and that it needed to be ordered at Alma School and Walgreens.  

Later that evening, we went to Walgreens and we were told that they didn't have any record that the prescription had been ordered.  Worried, we went to the other Walgreens on Dobson and Warner and they said the same thing.  Thinking there may have been a mistake in the pharmacy company, we even went to CVS but none of their locations showed anything was ordered.  After driving around for an hour and a half, I began to realize that Healing Hearts never ordered the prescription.  HEALING HEARTS NOT ONLY DIDN'T ORDER THE PERSCRIPTION, THEY LIED ABOUT ORDERING IT. 

To put it simply--my son had a nasty fever all night, the vomitings continued, and he slept that night roughly an hour.    

The following morning, 4/14/2016, I called Healing Hearts to speak with a manager or doctor so that I could file a complaint.  I spoke with Tatiana who told me that Sonia wouldn't be in until 9:30am, and that the office manager Vick and the doctor had a meeting and she would have them call me back.  I asked who is responsible for ordering prescriptions and she told me it would be the doctor/nurse that attended us--in this case Sonia  I called the other location in Gilbert to inquire about where I could file a complaint and said that all complaints needed to go through the Chandler office administrator Vick.  I was transferred to his voicemail.

Vick called me back, and then in a defensive tone he proceeded to tell me that he shows that it was ordered electronically and that they would order it again to make sure it went through.  Who am I to hold responsible, Walgreens or Healing Hearts?  There comes a certain point where you have to take responsible for your errors and mistakes, don't blame the technology when your offices customer service is reprehensible.    

To say the least, my family will NEVER go back after experiencing what happened with Healing Hearts and Sonia.  I would not be surprised if this problem is just tip of the iceberg for the real issues happening there.

Also we order the favorite shrimp (which is that sweet mayo shrimp) and sesame chicken. Okay the favorite shrimp was disgusting. The sauce tasted old and I couldn't even stomach to eat it. The side of broccoli was just drizzle with soysauce and salty!  the sesame chicken was average however I did enjoy how they didn't soak it in sauce.

My beef salad did not come with cucumber, mint, and cilantro. If you list the ingredients on the menu then it should be in the dish. I also had to wait 24 minutes to get my beef salad. It took over 40 minutes to get my final 2 dishes, drunken chicken and larb. We had asked for medium spice for both dishes but instead got mild. My girlfriend said that she enjoyed the flavors of the dish. I agree, the dishes are good but one dimensional in flavor. 

Thai food is built in layers. You add spices, chili, savory meats, and layer additional flavors by adding crushed peanuts, bean sprouts, cilantro, and mints. Eating each dish was like getting a good hamburger, bun, and cheese but leaving out the onions, lettuce, tomato, pickles, mayo, mustard, and relish. 

Considering the options in the Las Vegas area, I would recommend that you give this place a try.  It's worth a visit but don't expect to be blown away by authentic Thai flavors.

The overall decor looks exactly the same to me so I am not sure if the millions were spent here, but honestly all buffets pretty much look alike.

We only came here for lunch so most of the cooking stations were not open, the ones that I noticed  but were closed were a noodle station and a crepe station.  Food quality was very good here, the only thing that didn't look fresh to me was a couple of fish dishes and fish almost never looks fresh.  Our favorite dishes were the Korean Short Ribs, Pork loin, super sweet corn on the cob and sweet corn chowder.  The lychee ice cream was also a hit for me with real pieces of lychee in the yummy ice cream.  There wasn't much seafood or expensive cuts of meat available for lunch (no prime rib) but the prices were pretty reasonable.   Lunch was $27 and dinner is $40.  The Friday Seafood dinner is $50 which is pretty darn cheap for a high end Vegas buffet.

Overall we enjoyed this buffet, quality and service were good and pricing was affordable.  Although there wasn't any stand out dishes to make us yearn to come back this is a good choice for Vegas Buffets.",8,qZ3sJPn5NqSVFMLYGAJH_A

The egg roll was good, but the sweet/sour sauce it came with was better than I've ever had.  Simple, sweet, and not gooey or gloopy.  

One of the owners (a wonderfully pleasant aging Japanese woman) came to my table and offered me chopsticks and hot mustard -- we had a delightful conversation wherein she explained that the chicken is hormone-free and char-grilled over pumice stones, and their sauces are home-made from family recipes.  They also offer many healthy options, including brown rice and vegetarian dishes, and NO MSG IS ADDED!!  She was a fantastic host.  

Everyone seemed to be hurrying around, but they were all doing a great job keeping the customers happy by refilling drinks, delivering orders and making conversation with the people inside and outside the shop.

Long & Qua:

I decided to hit Qua after looking out at the pool at Caesars and seeing it swarming with people.  I didn't feel like fighting for a chair out there so I went into Qua and got a day pass.  It wasn't nearly as crowded as the pool but for a Spa, it was pretty crowded.  

Qua is big inside and has at least 5 hot tubs in the mens area.  There are also 2 steam rooms, a dry sauna, and the famous arctic room (my favorite).  There is also the lounge area with TV and chairs, bevs, fruit, etc.  

One of the other things I liked were the heated stone lounge chairs.  I could've relaxed in one all day, but they need to turn the heat up on them.

I didn't get a massage when I went to Qua.  I was discouraged because they don't waive the $40 day spa fee if you get a full service.  That's a little lame if you ask me.  

The only reason Qua doesn't get 5 stars is because there is no outdoor area.  Can someone, ANYONE please make a spa that also has a large outdoor area to lounge at?  Glen Ivy in CA still has everyone beat on that one.

Their wings are some of the best I've had, and I don't say that lightly. I LOVE hot wings and am pretty picky about them. Red devil makes them super crispy with lots of sauce. If you get nothing else here, get the hot wings!",5,7M1zIE6OzpySDlqLU6MnEg

The food is FRESH. As fresh as it comes in AZ. They pride themselves on quality. It ain't bragging, if it is fact!  I had the jumbo shrimps.  They were hand breaded in house.  Any one else out there that hand breads their shrimp? Even the big name fish houses usually bring them in breaded. Let's focus on the breading; taaaa.sty! Very tasty.  Made-to-order onion rings (with the same beautiful breading) are a nice touch. If you are looking for the best deep fried seafood and fish, give them a try.

VZOlFKHD6PEQVv9aDs1u_w,0,2014-04-01,0,AVD020pRBn1Ubnrk-A3WPw,0.0,"Stopped in once to ask about my laptop battery not charging (I had read Dell Diagnostics and support threads, but wanted to take it in first before I got into buying parts). The visit was probably 10 minutes and the guy at the counter literally just turned the computer on to see the ""not charging"" message, turned it off and directed me to Batteries Plus. Needless to say I was a bit surprised, but I thought maybe he was trying to save me some money. 

So off to Batteries Plus I go, where the only battery they had in stock wasn't a complete match and did not work on my system. They offered to order me a replacement battery for $170, but I figured I could get a better deal online. So I ordered a replacement battery and AC adapter just in case. Both come and I try them with no success. My computer won't recognize the new battery. While testing all this I realized that there was a BIOS update I needed, but wouldn't run because my Dell battery didn't have enough charge and the replacement battery wasn't recognized. 

So I went back to Data Doctors with all the parts and explanation of what I had found. I suppose I should have turned around as soon as they couldn't take my credit card info because their router was down (not good for an IT/computer company to have IT issues). For some reason they asked to keep the replacement AC adapter, but not the replacement battery only to call me 2 days later and ask for the battery (never mind that their hours mean I am late to work if I have to stop by). So by Friday afternoon, after having my computer for 5 days, I called to check on it because 5 days seemed like an awful long time to have my laptop. They told me almost word for word what I told them was the problem on Day 1. The diagnosis was that I needed a Dell battery and not a generic replacement. It took them 5 days to tell me that. 

They also told me they had discovered some Trojan viruses on my computer. I was skeptical since I have been shelling out money to McAfee for years. So when I got my computer back I ran a scan, which came back negative, but when looking at the scanning history, I was reminded that McAfee did find 4 viruses 2 YEARS AGO and had quarantined them.

I am glad I got my laptop back when I did and am sorry I didn't ask for a refund because the only thing Data Doctors did for me was prevent me from having a usable laptop for a week. I certainly don't need them to order me a Dell battery, when I can do that myself. I was under the mistaken idea that a computer repair company would have spare parts to test systems so that I could have diagnosed the issue before having to go out an replace parts one by one. I should have called my company's IT department back in Virginia because they would have been more helpful.

I can't speak to other locations, but I will never patronize the Ahwatukee store again. I did ultimately resolve the problem when I found PHX CPU. Since I had pretty much done all my own diagnostics, I realized it was either the DC power jack or motherboard. Thankfully, it was the former and PHX CPU replaced my power jack and my laptop is running perfectly again.",3,kVVwLexO6MwRzaJRP8w_sw

I received a very nice Swiss-made watch from my company for completing so many years of service. The band was too large and needed to be adjusted. The first jewelry store I went to couldn't do it because the band was rubber (no, not a ""gum band,"" you 'Burghers :) ) That store referred me to Jared's because they sold the brand of watch I received. 

When I walked into Jared's a woman greeted me at the door and asked how she could help me. I explained what I needed and she led me over to another woman who looked at my watch. While she was looking at it, the greeter asked if I would like some water or a cup of coffee. She agreed that she could adjust the band and explained it was done by cutting off segments. She said she would cut it down one segment at a time and re-measure it on my wrist because you can't go back up a size once it's cut. 

She took about 15 minutes, alternating between cutting the band and measuring it on my wrist until I was satisfied it fit right. I asked how much I owed. 

""Nothing, I won't charge you for that,"" she said. 
""But I didn't even buy it here, that doesn't seem quite fair,"" I said. 
She said, ""The next time you need jewelry, I hope you'll think of Jared's and come back and see me."" 

A friendly greeting, offering refreshments, and adjusting a watchband for an item I didn't even purchase from them... for free? I am struggling to imagine how my experience could possibly have been any better.

For those unaware, basically a Pork Sandwich Mexican style. It seemed as though they had no idea what to do. First, the guy up front walks me through what I want on it, then he hands it off to some mysterious person in the back. My GF gets the Veggie Burrito. We also used the special Yelp offer for an order of the Free Mini Churros. The girl at the cash register was very nice but seems a bit stumped by the whole ordeal. So we are told to sit down and they will bring me my Torta. The GF is about 2/3's of the way through with her Veggie Burrito when my Torta magically arrives at our table. All the while her Veggie Burrito is starting to fall apart from all of the juices/oil, we aren't sure. I unwrap my Torta to discover it is one sloppy, congealed mess. Not very appetizing to look at and fell apart at my 1st bite. Flavor was ok but the whole thing was just a disaster. I took it back up and had them make me a Carnitas Burrito. It was marginally better but the same as with my GF's Veggie Burrito, it fell apart about halfway through. And that's about as much as I ate. We dumped the remainder into the trash and agreed never to visit a Chronic Taco ever again.

Then the Store Manager came out. He knew we had a bad experience and wanted to know what all went wrong. He also informed us that this store was the numero uno location in all of Chronic Taco. We told him everything as written above. He also said he was in there with his family trying to have lunch and it was a miserable failure at best.

TUESDAY WINGS AT BOOKERS!!!!  lb of wings for $4.99
THEY SMOKE THE WINGS!!!!

They had me at this selling point.  So a group of 10 at a table...now before I go on further, this turned out to be one of the worst wing nights we've ever had.  It even came to the point we were outside talking about how we will do our next chicken fry for July or August.  So for the few of us drinks came, for others they were waiting for quite a bit...meaning 20-25 minutes.  So not really starting off with a good experience.

So finally our drinks came and we look over the menu,  Everyone was coming to an agreement they were ready to order.  Unfortunately we were not attended to for 20 minutes.  This caused for one of us to approach the bar to have the bartender send over the waitress.  That took another 20 minutes til we got our order taken.

So we gave our orders to the waitress.  Keep in mind its 16 orders of wings.  There were 2 entree orders, 5 side orders of jalapeno mac and cheese, and an order of fries.  Not to bad of an order for the night and drinks.

So by now its coming to an hour and 15 minutes, we are antsy for our food.  Our waitress came out to tell us our food is coming and explained that instead of individual plates for the wings, it would be grouped.  This meaning wings would be on a platter.  She also indicated the wings are not tossed in sauce, individual sauce cups will be given.

So we nod and smile and finally the food starts coming out, they give 3 platters of wings and a platter of various sauces in a cup.  For the people who ordered salt and pepper wings, the shakers are in the middle of the table.  Salt and pepper the wings themselves....FAIL!!!!!  The girl who dropped off the sauces to us didn't even take the time to tell us which sauce was which:  Buffalo, Carolina, Kansas City, or Maple Bourbon....FAIL!!!!  Don't get me wrong I think we were able to figure the sauces out from sampling.

So as we are eating, we notice that the wings were gone pretty fast.  Now out of the 10 of us, 6 of us order 2 lbs of wings.  Now don't think we were being petty but the amount of wings we ate in total came up to approx 75 wings.  I asked the waitress how many wings usually come with a pound.  she advised 8-10 wings.  so in my calculation that would be based on 8 wings each 128 pieces.  So if  ""WE ARE COUNTING WINGS"" per the manager we are still short 51 wings.  As the waitress was about to clear our table, I asked her about the wings and that we may short wings as customer.  She asked if we wanted more, but we decided that what ever was brought out to us they can charge, what was not brought, just take it off the bill.

15 minutes later this guy with his ball cap backwards approaches us.  He indicated he was the manager, cool, brought to his attention we might short of wings in our order.  He gave us the same option for them to bring out the remaining wings or what we would like.  We just asked if they could remove the wings that were not brought out.  He then turned and may have muttered the f-bomb.  I wasn't the only one who heard, but also another person.

So we are sitting at our table, the table hasn't been cleared.  We are waiting for our bill.  The waitress comes and asks how many orders need to come off the bill.  We didn't know what to say as how do you measure a pound out by wings that are already eaten.  So we went off by their estimates of wings per order ratio.  8-10.  Unfortunately an agreement could not be made of how many orders to be taken off.  So essentially it was agree 8 orders of wings to be charged.  So the waitress was gonna seperate the bill.  The bill came back with us being charged 9 orders.  We asked if it was 8 and she said she would make the correction.

Another 20 minutes roll and the manager comes back and asks if we have finished counting wings....seriously ok, yah I can take a joke.  But I can't speak for the other people and it came down to 2 guys at our table vs the manager, I was stuck in between.  So the manager was saying we wanted him to take off another order of wings.  He even said he already taken off half the bill???  Umm lets see 5 bucks times 8 orders....$40...Thats not half the orders we made.  Pretty much he indicated to us he will get the bill corrected and have us leave their establishment....Really?  

Ok, so yah we were not feeling it so we got the bill which the waitress seperated for us.  There were issues with certain orders mixed with other peoples bills...lets just pay and get the hell out.

So after reading this I hope you didn't spend 2 hours and 30 minutes reading this because that was how long it was for our experience with Bookers.  

You know whats even funny, before we even went, talked about the all you can eat crab special,  sundays $42.95, not no more.  3 of us that were planning on going.  Thats approx 126.00 for food, plus drinks and tip not being spent there.

God bless and happy eating....somewhere else!!!",4,UuBW51xKZqbmm6J-KKIp3w

It is an Oliver and Bonacini restaurant, so i expected top quality - they definitely charge top dollar.  Not so.  Canoe costs about the same and is lightyears ahead in quality.

I had the beef sirloin and shortrib - very ordinary, none of the amazing flavours like at Canoe. Sirloin was undercooked by two levels.   Squash soup was good, but nothing mind blowing. 

My girlfriend's turkey salad was average. The turkey had an old and stale aftertaste.  Def not what i expected from Oliver & Bonacini.  Her lamb was good, but again, nothing extraordinary like in Canoe.   Definitely not worth even the Winterlicious price, let alone the a la carte.

All beers start at $10.  Ordinary brands.  Glasses of wine start at $14.  Ordinary wines. 

For Trump haters - no worries, this place only rents the brand, it's not owned by him, and heard that it will be changing the name soon.",0,4sGwJy5Oplz8QXLgD8dr2w

Benefits of this place is the ample parking in the back. Not often you eat downtown and there is a parking lot. This plaza is so big with it's parking lot they could build a condo on it (and who knows, they might).

This restaurant is quite large with plenty of seating. The decor though looks a bit dated, despite being on outskirts of Liberty Village/Parkdake/TrinBellwood hipster areas.

I can't help but compare it to this other roti place I went a week earlier. This place is much cheaper in the $7-9 range, though there is not as much filling as the other place. It still tastes great though!

The staff has that carribbean/jamaican laid back aura. Helpful, but not the fastest.

Still, there's a lot of love for rotis and Island food in my books. This place keeps churning them out for many years of consistency.",1,nCRPCQE7E1PV83uQrIf7Cw

My husband and I came in for a full body massage. We originally wanted the 1 hour massage (price on the board was $36), so we thought okay, that's fine. Then the guy up front, said 'how about 75 minutes more for $3 more?' I said, 'Okay, sure, what the heck, it's only three dollars more"". And considering the reviews, it was supposedly great! 

So, I go to alot of massage places and what I tend to do, is, I look at the time, right before they put their hands on me. In this case, it was 3:50 p.m. So, I'm counting the 75 minutes after which should be roughly 4:05 p.m. the staff is nice, understandable.  They had me soak my feet in the bucket (I'm Asian so I go to a whole lot of Asian massage places. When they tell you to stick your foot in the bucket first, it's considered a foot massage, which is usually cheaper) the other Asian places, when I ask for full body, I'm laying on my back with a sheet over me, and they literally spend 40 minutes on my back and maybe the remaining 20 for the entire body. 

When he walked in again, I asked him again, 'this is a deep tissue back massage right? (or full body, NOT foot massage)'.  He said 'yes, yes, we do back 30 minutes'. Of course the girl that was massaging my husband didn't understand a lick of English so she couldn't respond. So I was thinking, okay maybe they do it differently. So we went on with it.  

During the massage, my massage guy (grant it he's nice) but business is business, if you don't have time to sit and do my massage you should get someone else. OR get someone else to tend the front desk.  He kept walking in and out throughout MY MASSAGE which could've cut off a good 10 minutes. (And no it wasn't to get the supplies, because when I look over to my husband, his girl was still massaging him). He would come back to apologize for leaving, so I said no prob, BUT also thinking, 'oh, maybe he'll make up the time in the end.'

Anyhow, time goes by, when I had to flip on my belly so my back is up, I took a glance at the clock again and I was thinking okay there's technically 25 minutes left, so he'll probably use the remaining  for the back. 

He only rubbed my back, didn't get under the shoulder blades, didn't single out any muscle areas, he literally just rubbed up and down my back with both hands... that's all. Didn't work in sections, like others do. So when, they say, 'okay, done'. I asked aloud ""that was 75 minutes?"" He responds, 'yeah'. I looked over to the clock and it was just barely tipping past 4:50 p.m. (that was 60 minutes, not 75!). I looked, over to my husband and said, that wasn't even our full time. So I'm thinking, I'm just going to tip $5 each, but since I didn't have two $5 bills, I had a $10 and $5, so $7.50 each now, because this is not what we expected!! And even considering giving tip, should be good already, thinking back how I DIDN'T EVEN GET MY FULL TIME WITH HIM WALKING AWAY AND COMING BACK! 

So when we walk to the front, the girl gave us the 60 minute price, my guy corrected her and says, in Chinese, 'no it was the 75 minute. So she charged me for that.  Then she asked, 'cash or credit for tip?' We said cash, and handed them the $15 to split (because at this point I'm displeased with my service) usually I always tip $10+, not in this case.  When we handed the cash, the guy said, something else in Chinese and she turns to me and says, ""oh we have a $10 minimum tipping policy"". I thought, 'What the fuck!? You have got to be fucking kidding me.' So I just looked to my hubs and told him, whatever,  just give it to them so we can go.

Now thinking back, I shouldn't have given them anything!  Not only did you get my service wrong, I ask for back massage not foot spa, you didn't spend my whole 75 minutes on me, In fact you cut our time short, and now that I'm even giving you something.... you are telling me, how much I HAVE TO TIP YOU!!  I was really looking forward to this massage too! Therefore, they get this long 1 star review because I've never been soooo disappointed in a massage place ever.",10,asiJAO4-Lta1AC-BTxDRgA

What I didn't love...The food. We just got appetizers, so perhaps the main courses are better, but the calamari was cold (and tasted old), and was smothered in a strange sauce. The sliders were better for sure, but nothing amazing.

So to get the regular treat I give my car, I had to cough up $60 with $3off like I mentioned when I checked in. There was a line today, I guess I wasn't the only one that wanted to drive a shiny car while running errands for Thanksgiving ;-). While I was waiting the manager walked by and gave me a smile, I'm thinking she knows me by now. After the wash portion was done, she opened my door and called me by my first name! Have I mentioned that I like that? Yes, yes I have... Anyways, I said, wow I'm here so often that you now know my name. And she says, oh it's on your receipt. Well that ruins the feeling of being the duchess of this place, j/k. 

The wait took an hour today, but people were kind and friendly, employees and patrons alike. No one seemed to mind that we were there waiting for our cars to be washed while the stores were getting busier and busier by the minute. When my car was done getting her diamond treatment, I expertly ;-) examined my car and pointed out some spots missed. The manager came up before I got into my car and wished me a happy holiday. Happy Thanksgiving Alamo, kudos to keeping your sanity today. See you in 2 weeks! 


Update 11/2/17- Arrived a little after 4pm, the manager was cashiering today. I purchased the Yelp $22 and added interior and exterior dressing like usual. She was charging me $20 for it today. I told her I don't remember paying that much before. I said I'd have to look at my records to see how much I've paid in the past and she took $2 off. She did say I paid $10 in the past but the leather seat conditioner would not be included. If you read my last review, this was included. I had my son with me today and my other 2 were getting haircuts so I was in a rush and didn't have time so I just agreed. I did mention the exterior trims were not dressed in the past so she said she'd make sure they were done this time. 

They have a new brand of air fresheners which does not carry the scent new car so I picked new leather. We shall see how this works out for me. 

The car was very clean and I'm satisfied with today's service. Good job Alamo!


Update 9/19/17- Back to 4 stars Alamo. 

1. Very happy with my car wash today. They took extra time washing my car.
2. The cashier knew what he was doing today. I told him to inform the guys that I was not happy with the interior dressing last time I was there. 
3. They were out of my favorite new car air freshener. Booo!! Got summer linen and I regret it. My car now smells like fresh laundry. Hehe
4. Josh (the guy doing my car today), applied leather conditioner on my seats! Good, I had planned on buying some on Amazon this month and doing it myself, now I don't have to . Hey, no malice, he was cute  . But what's important is.... he did a great job on both interior and exterior dressings. I'm wondering though if the trims are not included? I'll have to ask that the next time I go. I also told him that I always see tire dressing splatters on the side of my car when I get home, he said he'll make sure that doesn't happen. When I got home, no splatter. Kudos Josh. 
5. I think the manager being there (I saw her) made a lot of difference. 



Very bad experience today. I decided it was time to get my car waxed and paid $60 cause I added the interior and exterior dressing. My car Iooked better before they waxed it. I really couldn't tell the difference before I left the lot due to my car having that new car shine still and thought maybe it was their blue shade that was causing some shadows. I've been there long enough due to the cashier making a mistake on my Groupon. She didn't add the hand wax on my receipt so they were trying too give me my keys without waxing my car. I think this is why the wax job is sub par. They rushed the waxing and when I got home and could inspect it more closely, I spent about 30mins fixing the spots they missed. There was wax stuck in the crevices of my car. I felt cheated. My interior is also flawless and was excited to treat it with a dressing. As I was driving home, I noticed missed spots on my steering wheel and my console. I'm very disappointed by the service today, considering how much I paid, how often I come here and the fact that my car looked better with the regular gold car wash. My car doesn't even look like I paid for an exterior dressing except maybe for the tires. Which I must also add, had splattered on the side my car after driving home which I had to also wipe off. I should've done it myself and saved myself $60. 
Maybe coming right when they open was a mistake. It didn't seem like there was a manager. I had to ask 3 people for my air freshener before I got one! Thumbs down.",30,1x89yXeDnFTcx0L_z0kvQA

The texture of the noodle is what makes it for me and I can appreciate a good chewy consistency. It's so hard to find a good one as I feel like most care more about the broth flavours. This place definitely delivered in terms of the noodle texture. One of the best I've tried, but this is where it ends for my Magic Beef. The broth, while good, was nothing special. Same goes for the beef.

There were many other side dishes that looked delicious as well. I would definitely come back for the noodles because it's my thing and try out other items on the menu.",0,QCdJJlKPxkWzE505cMKIWg

I came in around 2:30 after my shift at work and decided to get the turkey artichoke sandwich that I've had before that I enjoyed very much. I ordered it with no mayo, onions or the pickle on the side due to my strong dislike for them. 

I waited patiently while they made my sandwich and while I was in no rush I sipped on the delicious pink pi√±a colada smoothie on this hot summer day. I noticed some other customers that were in my view walked up behind the counter because the guy apparently wanted more tea and there weren't any filled up by the beverage station. The guy who might have been a manager (since he was wearing a headset) seemed very annoyed that they did that. I agree it was rude to walk back there without asking, but what does he expect when the teas for the customers weren't filled at the beverage station? The man responded to him just saying it'll take 15 minutes to make more. No apologies were given to the man in need of some more tea. 

The girl who originally took my order brought me my sandwich and I politely thanked her and got up and checked my sandwich just due to past experiences to make sure everything looked right before I left the place. Unfortunately, the pickle was still in there so I immediately threw it in the nearest trash can and also checked my sandwich to make sure the pesto butter was on there because they've left it off multiple times before. 

I went to the front and asked the cashier just to confirm that it does come with pesto and she didn't seem too sure so she asked the same man who was wearing the headset and he stated that it's a pesto butter and I said that I was aware because I've gotten it before and it didn't look like it was on there. Instead of just apologizing and giving me an extra side and letting me on my way the man asked the baker or the girl who was making the sandwiches in the back if she put it on there and she yelled back in an angry tone ""YES!"" And the guy looked back at me and said, "" She said she put it on there."" I just looked at both of them very confused because I was so surprised of how they handled this. 

Just to be clear, I was not upset until I received the worst customer service I could've possibly gotten. I wasn't expecting anything, but just an extra side of the pesto butter, but they just made me feel like I was a burden to them even though no one was in line behind me so I wasn't preventing them from helping someone else. 

I work in the food industry and they clearly could've known that since I was wearing my work uniform, and I deal with people's requests all day long, and since this was something so minor and how they dealt with this it made me never want to come here again. This isn't the first time the employees have showed poor customer service, but this is definitely the worst by far. 

One star for the smoothie, but I'd rather take my business elsewhere next time for better customer service.",5,cAiTeHplBiqPM6ihR4_5Bw

The tile guys were a little late in finishing their portion of the project and Chris was nice enough to stick around until they were finished.  I signed up for their preventive maintenance plan and it was well worth it.  Again, every step along the way Chris showed me exactly what he was doing and what was needed.

I've been a long time customer of one of the barbers there, Joe, and was happy to follow him when he moved here. Why? Well, he gives one hell of a flattop, that's why. This cut is a little tricky for some people, but not for him. It's perfect every time. I don't know about the other barbers there because I only let Joe touch my hair.

The place is tastefully decorated. It feels a little like what I imagine an old school barber shop might have been like, but more modern, of course. Everyone is friendly and you feel like they all know what they're doing. 

They offer various services and the prices are posted a board. I just usually get a cut. I do get a warm towel on the head and then a massage afterwards, which adds to the overall experience but not to the cost. It's those extras that I really like. 

At this point, I've been there a dozen times or more. I've never waited for my appoint, not once. That's awesome for those of us who are on the go and need to get in and out! Call ahead, I imagine it's a time saver.

One of the things I like about Umami is the late Friday and Saturday hours.  The restaurant itself is compact, nested on the third floor where Cantina is.  The entrance is on the side street though.  It was a bit hard to find it during the evening.  It's almost like a izakaya speakeasy! I like what their drink menu offers.  The specialty drinks are well-priced and easy to drink.  Another thing I like about Umami is the serving size.  It's not one of those restaurants where my stomach cries over how small the portions are.  For a party of two, their appetizer size are pretty big to share.

This time, we ordered the chawan mushi, chirashi, tonkotsu ramen, and some handrolls.  I did not like the tonkotsu ramen a year ago.  The bamboo shoot was overpowering the broth.  The broth in tonkotsu ramen is key, and they didn't deliver it.  Since Umami owner is a co-founder of Ki Ramen, I figured to give the ramen a try again.  I LOVE THE TONKOTSU RAMEN THIS TIME AROUND!  The broth isn't very salty but fatty enough.  My favorite part was the bone in cha siu.  I'd come back to Umami for that alone.  The chirashi has a beautiful presentation and good quality fish.  The handrolls were decent, but a little pricier and not much different than other places.  The chawan mushi egg was silky and smooth.  I'd love to come back and try the rest of the menu next time.

There was music blaring throughout, we could barely hear the server who greeted us. She was semi friendly but rushed us through when there was nobody else even behind us.

I'm not asking for Ellie Mae but sheesh they definitely have some stuff to work on. Now to address the prices and food. All ambience aside, the prices are way too high for the quality and stemware that their food is served upon. The salad I had was not fresh, anyone can open up a bag of ""salad"" toss it on a small black plastic plate sprinkle a little beans and oh I forgot to mention the whole 2 to 3 ounces of meat dabbled on top and call it a salad. Did I forget to mention they charge you $9.25 for it? Yes...yes they did. My husband had a 2 meat plate of flavorless meat. They charged $13 for that. I will say his portion size was much larger. However flavorless semi dry meat is much less to ever be desired again. Their sauce is vinegar based and has a distinct taste of plastic in the sticky overused bottles they sat in on the sticky plastic tables. My husband and I later that afternoon experienced some stomach discomfort for sure. I come from the south and y'all definitely have a thing or two to learn about hospitality, barbecue and pricing.

I went here after having seen a show at the Princess of Wales theatre (Book of Mormon for those interested) with a large group of people and they had no problem finding a place for us on the second level.

The place has an awesome beer selection, they advertise 50 on tap and I am sure it is close to that (although a few of them were out).  The beers are mostly European ones, with only a couple of Ontario microbrews but the options they have are great, and none of them are Molson or Labatt swill which earns brownie points in my book!  Our waitress was really friendly and helpful and she knew a lot about the beers and was able to offer good suggestions.   

There were no problems on the food side either, I had mussels and spicy sausage which were really tasty while everyone else had something they enjoyed as well.

I've been in a couple of times with my boyfriend and so far we've tried the shrimp po-boy, catfish reuben, lobster roll, and $1 Sea level oysters.

The lobster roll could use a little more butter drizzled on top, but that's my only critique of the food so far. 

What I really love about Sea Level is that it seems to strike a great balance of semi-fine dining, while also being casual, if that's what your mood is. To that end, there's a big patio, and a good bit of bar seating, so even on a busy weekend evening, you may be able to be seated without a reservation at one of the aforementioned locations. Additionally, the service is fabulous. The servers are very professional - They know their stuff and they ensure patrons have a great dining experience. Finally, I love that there are cheaper options (i.e. $2 beer, $5 house wines, ~$12 sandwiches, and $1 oysters), and there are plenty of high quality, more expensive options as well.

I'm stuffed.  Add to that the 2 for 1 bottle beer special on everything, even the Negra Modelo?  Nice.  I asked when they normally have that and the girl said always?  Sounds good to me

Sides . . . haven't had many.  Their baked beans have always been good though a tad pricey (most of the sides seemed over priced outside of a combo).  I rarely order fries (but will always bogart one of two of yours if you order them) and they're better than fast food average

What I don't like?  The sauce . . . well, the sauce is decent, but barely a whiff of heat or fire.  It's no surprise the main ingredient is ketchup.  Has nothing on the sauces at Lucille's and Famous Dave's.  Was a nice touch though that they keep a warm kettle crock of it on the counter for us

I've been to HB's a bunch of times, but met with some friends for lunch today.

Overall, still great for some quick BBQ if you're in the area.  I especially like the pulled beef because it seems to hold the smokiness the best, and I love that you can also just buy the meat itself by the pound.  That way you can take a pound or 5 out, then bread and sauce it at home however you like",1,LUTiF1sD99N6yAmdZywA1w

Aloha Hawaiian BBQ I have found to be the closest.  It is pretty much like most all the other Hwaiian restaurants out here.  In fact, they all start looking alike after so long.  And the food is all about the same.  

On this visit I ordered a Katsu 1/2 plate (one scoop of rice vs two).  It came with the katsu, rice and a scoop of macaroni salad.  You know, the classics.  I also got another clcassic in Spam Musubi.  That is kind of my basic judge of a Hawaiian Restaurant.  I did not have to wait too long to receive my food.  Just long enough to witness the interaction between the cashier and the next party of customers.  All of them were of Asian background.  Their speaking to each other sounded almost angry at times.  As if they were yelling at each other.  I think I even heard them arguing on price.  Maybe it is a cultural thing.  I don't know.  It was kind of entertaining regardless.  

Any how, I got my food to go and took it home to eat in peace.  At leastsome of the food made it home.  I took a big risk in trying to eat the musubi on the road.  I did OK.  The nori was tender enough that it was not a chore to bite through.  This helped to hold in the Spam where in some cases it slides right out the other side on bite one.  What bothered me just enough to reall is the sauce on this musubi.  I am used to a more teriyaki style sauce.  This was more like a hoisin with a mildly spicy kick.  It was not necessarily bad just not what I had expected.  As for the katsu plate when I got home, it was hit and miss.  The katsu and sauce were on point.  The rice was as good as sticky white rice can be.  The macaroni salad was not great.  Half of it was burried beneath the rice and getting warm.  It was a little gross.  The final impression was that the chicken was not on a bed of shredded cabbage like at L&L but rather on a bed of shredded lettuce that wilts whe in contact with hot fried chicken.  Not the most appetizing of garnishes.

Aloha Hawaiian BBQ is not going to be my number one go-to but for a quick go-to close to home, it does the trick.",2,eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw

1. Few Guys get drunk (Check)
2. Decide to open a Brewery (Check)
That's it folks that all that is needed guys are simple so this rule applies to opening a bar or starting a band etc. Now it helped the guys who opened this place worked in a brewery and were recently laid off from work. 
The location is pretty amazing as its located right next to the Rogers and Metro Toronto Convention Center i.e. I bet that results in automatic clientele kudos to the owners on picking this spot.
I came here for a tour of the brewery (though it helped it was a hot day and I was looking for a cold one). The tour starts with a sample of the beer (now why don't all tours start like that is beyond me!) and one is given a bottle of beer midway through the tour (I bet they came up with that idea too when they were drunk) so kudos for that. The tour itself is nothing special as one just get to walk around the brewery and listen to mundane stuff. Though I commend the brewery for their keeping it green initiative. 
The event space is quite nice and I can see it being a good place to host events.

The doctors have changed a few times but have always been great. The problem I have currently have is that the office staff is well, terrible. I needed to come in for specific immunizations, scheduled the appt and arrive only to find out that I was scheduled the one day of the week they don't offer them. So, I take another hour and a half to come back the next day and get it taken care of. In the meantime the office staff tries to collect payment for a well visit (which is always covered by insurance). I then need to return for more immunizations the following week (which the nurse told me is always covered) and the day before the appt they call to get insurance information. Uh, I was there a week ago and pretty sure it hasn't changed. Ok, their mistake. At the second, or actually third, visit they again ask for payment for an office visit. I tell the office staff that the nurse told me that follow up immunizations are always covered. No, she was incorrect. You still have an office visit to pay for. Ugh. The nurse should not be giving information regarding fees if they don't know for sure.

Back when I moved into PGH, I did have a car, and obtained the residential permit necessary to park in my neighborhood (N. Oakland).  Go figure, when I went to the office to do so, the meter I first tried to park at was broken, and wouldn't accept any of my quarters.  (This is back in the day when the old meters still existed.)  I should have recognized this as a metaphor for PPA's dysfunctionality.  As it were, I just reported it to them.

As anyone who's ever been to N. Oakland knows, parking there is a real PITA, and the street that my apt. bldg.'s on doesn't even have parking.  One day about two weeks later, after parking in one of my normal spots, I went to my car only to see a ticket on the windshield.  ""What the heck?"" I thought, since I had my residential permit prominently displayed.  Turns out I was parked within twenty feet of a crosswalk.  I wasn't aware this rule even existed, but apparently, it does.  Way to welcome me to the neighborhood, PGH!

Since I was new to town and I'd heard that PGH parking court is a joke, I decided to contest the ticket.  It took me three calls to even get someone to answer the phone to sign up for a court date, since you couldn't schedule one yourself through their website.  I scheduled my hearing for an evening session about a month later.

Before I was ever able to go to court, a flood happened and totaled my car, making me even angrier about the situation.  I went to court with the plan of asking for leniency, given that I was new to town and newly carless.  When it was my turn, I took one look at the judge (a portly and stern-looking elderly woman) and knew I wasn't going to get off.  I didn't even get to finish my sob story before she cut me off.  ""It isn't our fault you didn't know the rules and that your car's wrecked,"" she said.  Good thing I had enough cash on me to pay the fine, since I don't think they even took credit cards.

Don't believe the stories about PGH parking court judges taking pity on you because you took time out of your day to show up and contest a ticket, regardless of the reason for it.  That court is a kangaroo court and they're out to do one thing--make money.  Be aware of the more obscure laws, which include not only parking too close to crosswalks, but also head-in parking only.  Check the parking signs carefully, feed the meters, and observe the time limits, and hopefully, you won't have the misfortune of dealing with these idiots.  You've been warned.

I won't even get into the exorbitance of their rates downtown and in Oakland...  Their slogan, ""The Value Parking Network,"" is laughable and downright disingenuous.",4,135DbbQnr3BEkQbBzZ9T1A

I have suffered from sleep apnea for years and have unsuccessfully tried the CPAP option - CANNOT SLEEP with the CPAP.  I visited the Chandler ""Core Sleep Solutions"" and in TWO short weeks Core Sleep Solutions basically changed my life!

I had tried a few appliances advertised on TV, however, none of them worked and they were PAINFUL to use.  I later discovered some people can ruin or lose teeth trying different TV offered appliances.  The oral appliance Dr. Core prescribed is PAINLESS and simple to use.

The process leading to the appliance was also simple.  The first visit consisted of x-rays and verbal discovery of my overall health.  The following visit consisted of a home sleep study confirming my sleep apnea and nightly oxygen depletion.  A succeeding visit entailed taking a molding image of my teeth.  Ultimately, I was issued the oral appliance.  Very simple steps.

The staff informed me of what to expect (increase and tapering off of dreams) and encouraged me to contact them if I experienced problems or side effects.  All questions were answered and I left their office looking forward to my first decent sleep in years!

The first night I had THIRTY dreams (it was like the Dream Flood Gates had opened).  The dreams subsided to a comfortable THREE a night by the end of the first two weeks.

I immediately noticed chest pains (from my over-beating heart) disappeared.  Not only was I sleeping through the night without choking, I felt RESTED and GREAT.  

Additionally, I discovered an increase in energy (enough to get me started on a walking exercise routine to lose weight).  Now I have energy to burn!

Dr. Gary Core and his Awesome Staff have literally SAVED MY LIFE!  It's WONDERFUL to sleep and wakeup refreshed.  2015 started with the unexpected loss of a family member and is ending with my life being restored!  

In a nutshell, ""Thank You, Dr. Core"" for my 2015 Christmas Gift""!

This was the ABSOLUTE BEST hotel we've ever experienced. The whole stay was amazing. I loved everything about our room and the size of it, the view and the bathroom was impeccable. The bathtub was huge, also inside the shower, a very modern feel.
The view is absolutely breathtaking. Since it's one of the only hotels off of the strip, the view of the strip is amazing. That would be the only inconvenience of the whole hotel, many taxi rides. You can walk to the strip, but it's a looong walk. It's better to go across the street to The Rio and take the shuttle from there to Harrah's, that's your best shot. Since there's three hotels that make up the Palms, you'll never really be bored there. The Palms Place is where you should stay (price-wise) for your room, the Palms Casino is just a short walkway from there. The actual casino floor of the Palms isn't extremely impressive, it's smaller than I expected, but of course, it gets the job done for gambling. The restaurants in the Palms are top-notch. N9NE Steakhouse was to-die-for. Best steak I've ever had. They have a cafeteria in the Palms Casino and it comes in handy when you're on your way back to your room for a late night snack. The pizza place in that section of the casino is pretty impressive. We ordered a pizza around 2 in the morning and took it back to our room.
The lovely cleaning room attendants cleaned our room everyday to the extreme, but not so much that I felt uncomfortable with them touching all of our things. And they left presents for us everyday. chocolates, robes, flowers. They really were amazing. 
You can't use your balcony anymore, because you can't use any balcony anymore in Vegas, which is upsetting now, because that would have been beautiful to sit out on at night, but still the view was just as beautiful from the door. 

I really was surprised by all of the bad reviews I read on them before writing this, I really don't even have a complaint and it just seems odd that so many people had such a drastically different experience than us. I can only go off of our experience, which was amazing. it's going to be hard for another hotel to live up to my standards of this one from here on out..that's for sure.",3,5AhF9d_s2AQtwDlEfQptIA

Every year The Kings play a preseason game in Las Vegas, and it always falls on my Birthday weekend.  This year mom wanted to join us so she could celebrate my birthday weekend with me.  To celebrate my Birthday she took me and my boyfriend out to dinner at Roy's at 7:30p on September 28, 2012.  I had an awesome Birthday experience!

We were lead to our table and handed customized Birthday Menus announcing MY Birthday!!!  This customized approach really adds to the reason's of why I'm glad I chose Roy's as my Birthday dinner place.  Our waiter Thomas, made for a very welcoming experience, his personality makes you feel as if you are right at home. He was very attentive and informative and was able to accurately describe all the dishes we asked about and make them seem tantalizing.  He also peaked our interest with some of the specials he described.  Throughout the meal we never had to want for anything as he was always available to serve us.

We decided we could order a few plates and share a bit as well.

To start -The Lobster California Roll:  I order variations of this roll at many places I frequent and Roy's did not disappoint.  Also the portion was a very good amount so that we were all able to share and there was still a piece or two left.

My Mom - Shellfish Sampler: The lobster tail was huge and very meaty.  It melted in your mouth.  The scallops we so tasty and also huge. The crab cake recipe was delicious.  The curry sauce drizzled over the meal was flavorful and just the right amount of spicy/smokey taste. They should really bottle and sell that stuff. Normally I don't go for alot of carbs but I couldn't stop eating the Macadamia Nut Pesto Risotto from her plate.  
Strawberry Daiquiri - How could you go wrong with this?  and Roy's did not disappoint. 

Me - Lilikoi Pear Salad: I love their Candied Macadamia Nuts! I was eating a salad but it definitely felt like I was cheating. There was plenty of Gouda cheese in the salad, unlike some restaurants who want to skimp on the expensive cheese.  The Asian Pears went great with the salad and the dressing balanced it all out.
DeLoach Pinot Noir from California - I loved this wine.  It was rich and had a slightly sweet red cherry or blackberry hint to it.

My Bf - Pan Seared Trout.  Again, the portion of the meat was more than expected. This fish was flaky and smooth.  The sauces and side dish pairings were detectible.
The Jalepeno Margarita - We are Tequila drinkers and our favorite mixed drink would probably be the margarita.  This is why this menu item piqued our interest.  This is definitely not your normal margarita but if you are in the mood to try something different it is one that I would recommend.

The Chocolate Molten Cake was very decadent.  The only problem was that I was stuffed! As the meal went on and on I was getting so full, but yet all the food was so delicious that I couldn't stop taking small bites of everything.  By the time the Chocolate Molten Cake arrived I could only squeeze in 3 or 4 bites.  Even as full as I was, it was the Best Chocolate Molten cake I have EVER had!  It was just crispy enough on the outside with a pool of creamy chocolate inside of light and fluffy cake.  So rich, but still edible. 

I would definitely recommend Roy's for any occasion.  Friends in town, Birthday, Anniversary, or just looking for some place to eat where you know you will get detectible food of good portions, no matter what you order, exceptional service and attentive staff plus a lovely ambiance.",0,XW3V6NtU6EFjIeJGWWKoGA

Three tacos are $14 and burritos are $14. Service was ok, the food didn't have a lot of taste. Soup of the day was $7. The prices are as high or higher than the ""fine"" Mexican restaurants located at the more upscale casinos. I think they will succeed if they drastically lower their prices.

Our waiter explained how right now they had a special menu for the chef which owns the restaurant (Alain Ducasse) and that we should order from that since it was ""better"".

We ordered a few dishes:
Shrimp Cocktail appetizer - It was good, made us feel a little excited about the dinner.  Ironically it was the best dish and the only one we got not on the Alain Ducasse menu.

Boneless Ribeye - It was not good.  I felt like I paid $46 for a USDA select cut of meat.  It wasn't tender and the fat wasn't juicy.  I cook better steaks on a stove-top at home.

John Dory ""Meuniere"" - The fish was dry, overcooked, and way underseasoned.  This dish was only 1/2 eaten.  

We didn't even order dessert since our main courses were so poor.  Somehow those 3 dishes totaled up to $140 even w/o drinks.  I think the waiter realized we weren't very happy, and brought us a little baked good with some nutella.  That was ok but we were happy to get out of there.

The lady at the registration desk was not friendly at all.  We got into our room and were immediately not impressed.  The room was very dark.  There was a small desk light and one end table lamp.  There was also a large lamp in the corner, but it was not plugged in for some reason.  It did work though, once we found the problem.  There was also some running lights around the room that did not work at all.  There was a missing drawer and missing doors in the dresser.  There was only one single accessible outlet, which we discovered later also didn't work.  We complained about the light at the front desk within an hour after checking in.  The desk clerk offered to move our room, but insinuated that it wouldn't get any better.  He did supposedly place a work order for the lights, although we never saw or heard from anybody and they were never fixed.  After showering the next day, I discovered there was no hair dryer in the room.  They brought me one the next day, and it did not work.  After spending three nights in the hotel, I was finally able to actually dry my hair!  We were staying at PH on New Year's Eve, and our friends that were travelling with us received information in their rooms about the street closing, but that was not provided to us.  We also learned from visiting other rooms, that our room was also missing an end table lamp.  Some other minor details, that I'm sure bothered me more based on our terrible experience...the furniture was haphazardly placed blocking access to the window, our bed was not made on the last day, there were two closets but only one had hangars.

Nice beer selection, though they were out of a couple things- not good for a busy weekend.

I like the space- 2 dining rooms, the larger in the back, the bar in the front.  Large B&W photos of Charlotte on the walls.  Decor is neutral and modern without being overly loud.

Despite the mixed review preceding mine, I was quite impressed with the quality.  Appetizer of Hummus and pimento cheese was delicious, though we had to ask for extra pita.   Both spreads were very creamy and tasted nice- that's saying something for a guy who usually rejects pimento cheese outright.

My dinner party shared a couple salads- a Caesar with real anchovy on top- nice and creamy, but pretty standard.  The better choice was the Roadside salad- mixed greens with red and golden beet slices and goat cheese.  Such a cool mix of flavors, I could've made dinner on a couple of these.  Probably seasonal, but it was a highlight for me.

For dinner we had the Steak medallions with eggs. Who'd have thought Hollandaise sauce of steak medallions with eggs ""cooked in a basket"" could be so yummy?  Also had the special ""chicken pot pie"" with some of the richest sauce ever- it was sherry-based and very filling.  Just a few bites were enough there.

We also had a couple sides, fries in white truffle oil- crispy, but the truffle taste was lost on me, couldn't find it and this was a definite let down.  Mac and cheese was good, though- homemade with real cheeses and a nice crusty top.

Dessert menu was brief, to say the least- shared a pecan pie that was nothing spectacular.  This portion of the meal underwhelmed- both in selection (maybe 3 options???) and execution.  

Overall I found service to be responsive and conscientious- they made sure to stop by when meal took a little longer due to a large rush of tickets.  The place was pretty busy all night, so I think word has caught on that MOFO has another young hit on their hands.

Foodie friends, this place is worth a checkout.  Disregard the roadside grill name, 15 North is looking to cater to a higher level of culinary expertise.  For the most part, I think they've got it.  Just count of doing dessert elsewhere!",2,AwyM03qzhwgyskBruurWQw

Just from passing through Cosmo on my previous trips to Vegas, I've been pretty fond of the place.  Their location is fantastic (between the Bellagio and Aria/City Center, and across the street from PH and Paris), and the design and d√©cor are pretty awesome (particularly the ""changing art"" in the elevators and lobby).  And while they aren't as large as other hotels on the strip, they have a ton to offer - the latest hot spot in Vegas (Marquee), restaurants galore (Holsteins!), a three level bar (The Chandelier), late night eats (Secret Pizza), shops (Kid Robot!) and my favorite buffet (Wicked Spoon!).  Despite all that though, it was my stay at Cosmo that impressed me the most.

While my friends and I have always wanted to try out the Cosmopolitan, their room rates have always pushed us towards cheaper alternatives.  As fate would have it though, a couple of my friends were able to find a great deal online for the weekend we were going - only $140 a night!  However, with suites going for just $20 more a night, I decided to upgrade myself.  Yes, you read that right - a suite just for myself...and it was the BEST.  DECISION.  EVER.  The suite was ridiculously nice - king size bed (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=q5V5Gp8j2gKI67Tsn1CU5w), separate ""living room"" area (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=3LtdG6s3yKaRruPsy1sqbA), kitchenette (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=eUnijzgD54vUz7BhZANnJw), walkout balcony (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=3n1FgIqv2yDFrDpYLob72w), two flat screen TV's, separate tub and shower (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=svlV_W_Z81nArE3oubllCg), dual sinks(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=5lxiFXsbbJxtzeZ63l9a0w)...way more than I actually need from a hotel room.  And it was awesome! 

Even though my stay was great, their service made it that much better - every worker I talked to (front desk, maids, dealers, pit bosses, Beck and Call guys, bell hops) was super nice and friendly.  Cosmo offers so much to love and so little to dislike, I could only come up with one bad thing about them - now that I've spoiled myself with one of their suites, I don't know how I'm going to be able to go back to a regular room.

Crud.

**Quick notes:
- On Friday nights, guys staying at Cosmo can get into Marquee free until 11:00pm, provided they have a 1:1 ratio.
- There are two towers - East is closer to the main part of the casino while West is closer to the front desk/Wicked Spoon.  My friend had the same suite as I did in the East Tower, but his room seemed smaller.  Not sure if that's the case for every room or not though.",9,JKIkdVqAJLEXTq92gF98bA

I didn't know how to eat it. Without cutting, things fell off the bread unless I held it horizontally to eat. I also have a small mouth. 

I made the error to cut it into fours. The bread is only hard around the edges. The center is very soft and everything fell onto the plate. :-( tip - fold it in half and open up the mouth.

I had expected bruschetta as small pieces of toasted bread slices with stuff on top. That would have made this dish perfect!

Please bear in mind, my issues with this place stem from the fact we spent over $200/night here. I would have much rather spent that money to get a much nicer hotel (*cough*aria*cough). Had the hotel cost $100/night or less, my review would be much different.

My boyfriend and I went to Vegas with a large group for business/pleasure. The group decided on this hotel. Other friends of mine had warned me of how much they hated staying at SLS, but I figured they were exaggerating. After the weekend, I totally understand. 

Here's the thing (or many)... SLS is WAY off the strip. Think Stratosphere... You have to take a cab to go really anywhere, which is not my fav thing to do. Or you could take the train, but for me, no. 
When you get into SLS, it feels dark. The decor, design and actual lighting is dark. You think of walking into many of the nice casinos to at least a bright lobby. Not here. Also, what's with the monkeys everywhere? Don't get me wrong, the hotel is CLEAN and it is TRENDY, just not my style. Certain things about it feels...creepy. (see Photos)

We got to our floor and upon walking down the hallway, I was weirded out for real. The always are black with these Dr. Seuss feeling white grass things all the way down the hall. Dark carpet and mismatched numbers all willy nilly on the doors make you feel like you're in a dark themed fun house...not upscale, not relaxing. (see Photos)

Now, onto the room. Umm...again, the weird grassy paint with black, white and this super pale pink. What? Anyway, it felt so small and so CHEAP. I took many photos. You can just see for yourself. One small window with standard slat blinds (like at your grandma's house) and a pull down shade. So much light seeping thru the sides of the blind, not to mention the HEAT flowing in. GREAT..not getting that super dark hotel room sleep this weekend. Whatevs. Now...on the pull down shade is a photo of a crowd of people. Like their faces..over your head...on your bed. So weird. (see Photos)

The furniture in the room was so cheap. I felt like I might as well stayed at a Best Western dressed in alternative design. The table was an OCD nightmare (see Photo). The top of it was slightly off kilter, permanently. I kept wanting to move it! haha strange. The phone is on that table, across the room. There are two large mirrors on either side of the room, with lights bordering it. Kinda cool. Bright lights. The dresser/cabinet/closet piece was quite small and nearly pointless. It was taken up by mostly the mini bar. Who really touches that thing?? Anyway.... there are 4 medium sized drawers, one is filled with a safe. There are a few hangers to hang dresses/shirts. functional, but you have to look at it the whole time. You can't close away the closet, makes the room feel (again) cheap and messy. Can you tell I like my Vegas rooms to be neat, clean and relaxing? 

The bathroom was odd as well. Not much counter space to get ready (as a girl, you get it) so I had to do makeup and hair on the floor in front of the large mirror in the room. The bathroom felt like a senior citizen's bathroom. Railings everywhere. There was only a shower, no tub. The shower had a bunch of railings too, and a weird fold down seat. Super elderly. Also, the shower had no lip/divider to keep water from going across your floor. The first day, I made the mistake of leaving my clothes on the floor while showering.. soaking wet mess afterwards. The door is a sliding mirror door that doesn't lock and has a rather large crack/opening on the sides. So much so, you can see thru into the bathroom! Awkward. I have photos of all this, check it out. 

On to the restaurants and pool (I didn't play in the casino, so IDK about that). The choice of restaurants is slim. Coming from LA, they're all restaurants I can go to here in LA. Boring. I get it, SBE...but still. With SLS being so far from the rest of the strip, we ended up eating at these restaurants most of the time. Felt like majority of the restaurants were polar opposites. Either really casual ""inexpensive"" or super fine dining ""expensive"". Not much in the middle. 

The pool was decent (LUX pool). It wasn't ever super crowded, which I like. The drinks were okay. The food was normal. Music was good, not too loud, not too quiet. But the pool closes at 7pm! Before the sun even went down...okay... sure. 

Room service comes from the Northside Cafe in the casino. Good food, but you receive your room service in paper boxes, plastic ware, and no tray. So do yourself a favor and save the $15 in room service fees, just go order to-go from the restaurant yourself. Room service here is a JOKE. 

Overall, again, had this place cost us $100/night or less. I would let a lot of these things go. But knowing I could have stayed elsewhere, a place I know I LOVE for the same price, really bruises my bananas.",15,MAl4Fj9gKiSzo4Sec4eQcQ

It breaks our hearts when they close for the winter, but we know that come spring we will be enjoying their delicious food once again! 

We have eaten in and done takeout here many times, so this review is much overdue.  Takeout service is always quick and efficient. We are usually enjoying our meals within 30 minutes after calling and picking up (compare this to Thai Place in Aspinwall, which always gave us a 45 minute wait due to being ""busy"" but never had anyone eating in the restaurant when we arrived...). 

The indoor space is sparse but functional. There are simple tables and chairs, and not much decorations on the walls. Their outdoor space is gorgeous and generally what people go for when eating here. The garden is lovely and relaxing, with lights strung up around the beams and simple plants making the space inviting and relaxing. We attempted to eat outside yesterday, but gave way to the heat and ended up indoors. Someday soon we will enjoy our bottle of wine in the garden!

We typically order two different dishes and share. We start out with the fresh garden rolls, which are delicious. It is a small order, but the perfect start to a meal. The vinegar sauce is light and refreshing, but I do prefer the peanut sauce that Nicky's offers with their spring rolls. We have had the red, green, and pumpkin curries, and our favorite is the green. The sauce is more complex than the pumpkin, even though we love the pumpkin chunks! There are numerous fresh vegetables in each that soak up the wonderful sauce. We also share an order of brown rice, which is worth the extra cost. I recently had Thai in NYC, and I have to say that I loved the curry at Pusadee's much better! Their blend of spices and coconut milk is simply perfect. 

Pusadee's and Nicky's will continue to be our favorite Thai places here! I am so glad that Pittsburgh has more and more options for great Thai dining.",1,KAsmY6WCUWRYQXE_50AkQA

On 9/18/2016, I visited the CVS Pharmacy located at 8116 S. Las Vegas Blvd., Las Vegas, Nevada to use my 30% and 20% coupons.

Unfortunately the 30% and 20% coupons were not applied to the cologne I purchased. According to your Store Manager, Azucena (Suzy) the cologne was a buy one get one 50% off and the coupon doesn't apply to sale items. I advised the store manager, Azucena the product was not marked as a sale item and she rudely replied we're not expected to label every product that's on sale. Really, I'm a business owner myself and I expect my employees to do their job, it's disturbing a corporation as large as CVS wouldn't require the same from its staff, especially a member of their management team. Furthermore, if the proper sale signage was posted, they only had one in stock so they would be unable to honor the sale.

To add insult to injury when I requested the phone number from Azucena she threw the pin on the counter. Of course, I brought this to her attention and was abruptly dismissed. I have been a frequent customer at CVS Pharmacy's across the United States and have never been treated with such disrespect and disdain.

CVS Pharmacy should honor the coupons they send to their customers if the items are not marked properly by staff. Additionally, I suspect discrimination is a factor in this case.

If I was to rate this based on the single pour-over I have tasted from here, it would be a solid five stars. I was highly pleased to find that they had Akron Coffee on bar because Akron Coffee is the new best coffee in the [Akron] area. But it was my first time to try it so I played it safe with a Yirgacheffe pour-over which was said to have a pleasant balance of strawberries, cocoa and cinnamon. And yes, it was wow, quite pleasant indeed. It was very sweet and as it cooled it became increasingly buttery. In fact, the last of it got entirely cold and at that point it became one of the most butteryest, most smoothest, most bestest coffees I've ever slorked. In contrast, I sampled a bit of Oak Grove coffee of forgotten origin brewed via airpot, which was not so pleasant. 

They don't do espresso which is understandably a problem for some people. But for me, I find a bit of joy in seeing others as dedicated to high quality drip and filter coffee as I am myself.

I don't really see any other reason to. Sure, there are a bunch of restaurants, and  I think some shopping, but it's only there to kill time before or after a show. 

The parking here is THE WORST EVER if you're coming for a concert. Especially if there is also a football game happening next door. There are a ton of people directing traffic, but none of them are aware of what the other is doing. We sat in one spot for, no joke, like 20 minutes. Meanwhile we could see a parking lot not even half full right next to the road we were stuck on. Once we finally made it into the parking lot, there was no discernible reason for the traffic besides the people directing it stopping it for their own amusement. It's a nightmare.

I almost decided to just say ""fuck it"" and leave because of the horrible traffic.

Leaving wasn't too bad, except you have the same problem but in reverse. The traffic directors trying to control traffic, and the drunk and tired people completely ignoring them. Then once you get onto a major road, they have half the lanes blocked off for no apparent reason. 

Other than the terrible traffic, this place is all right. If you come on a night where there is a sold out show, be prepared for waits up to an hour and a half at every single restaurant.

Given how far the Galleria has fallen since it opened in the late 80's, my expectations for Cafe Sausalito--a restaurant I hadn't visited in at least 10 years--were very low.  I wouldn't have been that surprised to walk into a wasteland, complete with cobwebs and tumbleweed.  Instead, what I found was the pretty standard business crowd having lunch, filling about 70% of the seating inside (I didn't get a look at the ""outside"" dining area that is open to the Galleria food court).  Sausalito features a pretty large dining area with a large bar and two levels of tables (i.e., one level a couple steps higher than the other) on the main floor.

I had the beef brisket sandwich, which turned out to be a pretty sizable pile of beef brisket on a bun absolutely slathered in barbecue and honey dijon mustard sauces.  For the sake of my work clothes, I opted to go open-face on the sandwich and knife-and-fork it (something I very rarely do).  The mustard sauce overpowered the taste of the meat, but I could live with it.  The quality and the cooking of the meat isn't going to come close to rivaling even a chain barbecue place, but it was adequately cooked and fit the purposes of the sandwich.  It was the size of the portion that really surprised me.  I also liked the fact that I could substitute the fries with vegetables, which ended up being julienne green and yellow zucchini.

Service was pretty basic, though I thought it could have been a bit quicker for the simpler tasks like getting the check ready to go.  My leisurely (but cold) walk to the office and back (a little over three blocks) with lunch at Cafe Sausalito took about one hour and five minutes.  On top of that, my meal plus an iced tea cost me $9.10 before tip.  Not too shabby at all.",1,kHGRDaZt4nHgNSJcjOTDeQ

There is one girl who works morning with curly hair, and if I always got her, I'd continue to go here, but every other employee I've encountered there needs to get out of customer service and quick.

On my first visit, I intended to order an iced caramel macchiato. The girl with the curly hair gave me a hot one. I couldn't remember for sure that I'd said iced, so I accepted it without comment. She thanked me, told me to have a nice day, smiled, handed me my drink and I was on my way.

On my second visit, I got the curly haired girl again. Very similar to my first visit except my drink was made like I wanted. I was happy.

On my third visit, I was in a hurry so I decided to skip the drive thru and go inside. I was actually in such a hurry that I just ordered iced coffee. The couple that had been in front of me got their drinks, so I thought I'd be on my way soon. The male half of the couple got the barista's attention to let him know the drink was made wrong. By this time, I realized I'd made a mistake by stopping because I was going to be late. So I got a female barista's attention (not the curly haired girl..she has straight, blondish gold hair) and told her that I had to go and I just didn't want them to worry about making my drink. I promise you I was in no way rude. It wasn't their fault that I was in a hurry. I was just planning on forfeiting the $3 I'd paid. The older guy behind her asked me if I'd had the iced coffee. He sounded aggravated. I said yes, so the girl made it quickly and gave it to me. She was also clearly annoyed. I thanked them thoroughly and told them that that was unexpected but appreciated. They didn't reply. 

My last visit was in the drive thru again. Again, they were very busy. I ordered an iced caramel macchiato again. The older guy was at the window this time. He handed me a hot caramel macchiato. Since I was certain I'd said iced, I nicely told him that I had ordered an iced one. He was obviously annoyed. He said ""oh"" and took it back. They then poured the hot one over ice and gave it back to me. No apology or ""thank you,"" Ora asking me if it was okay that they just poured the hot one over ice...just a ""here you go.""

I had to stay here, there was a convention I had to attend for work taking place at this location. The conference will most likely be here next year too and I'll make sure to stay somewhere else. 
The food is gross and overpriced. The service was not good. As soon as we landed we attempted to locate the ""free shuttle"" that they advertise for bringing guests from the airport to the hotel. When we couldn't locate it we called the hotel and they told us that the shuttle had to be reserved 24 hours in advance and it was full for the day. He was incredibly rude and in hindsight he should have prepared me for the customer service standard this hotel holds.
The worst part of my stay here was the customer service (or lack thereof). The temperature was in triple digits so we decided to try the pool. There are two pools (one large one  and one smaller one that is probably for kids) and when we got there the larger pool was fairly empty. We laid by the pool for a little and then I started to climb in the pool. After a few minutes of wading around a life guard whistled at me. Apparently they were cleaning the pool and guests weren't allowed in due to the presence of chemicals. No sign, nothing stating this. I would have appreciated some type of warning before stepping into a contaminated pool apparently filled with cleaning chemicals but oh well. After I got out I noticed other guests making the same mistake and I even heard one remark, ""why isn't the pool roped off?""
So everyone starts gathering in the smaller pool. Not even 15 minutes later everyone is kicked out of that pool as well. Apparently it was also contaminated. Lovely. And once again, no warning sign, no roped off area. Again I saw many people walk into it not knowing it was contaminated. Eventually we went up to the room because it was clear we wouldn't get any time in the pool.
We decided to come back later at night to use the hot tub and relax. There is one hot tub with a sign at the entrance clearly stating, ""No children under the age of 16 allowed in hot tub area"". However, there was absolutely no one enforcing it. So the hot tub was over-run with children, splashing and swimming as if they were in the pool. We asked the life guard if there were indeed children allowed in the hot tub and he assured us they were not and then he asked them to leave. One parent became belligerent about his child not being allowed in the hot tub and the life guard had to call security. Not exactly the relaxing atmosphere one would hope for. As soon as the life guard left the hot-tub once again became filled with children. So we left. 
When I got back to the room I called the front desk to tell them I was disappointed by the events described above. She was not sympathetic and actually told me that it was my fault for not asking the staff to ask the children to leave the hot tub. When I told her that I did and it didn't help she then told me I should have called her instead. She then proceeded to tell me that there was nothing she could do about it but would I like a $15 food credit to my room? I would have much rather appreciated a caring/understanding/apologetic customer service representative and no food credit rather than receiving a measly $15 food credit and having to deal with the rude and condescending representative. 

TL;DR

The food is 5 stars all the way, but the service has often left something to be desired. Granted, I'm going during what I imagine is their busiest time on their busiest day of the week, but I always feel a bit like an inconvenience to the wait staff. 

I also struggle to understand a brunch place that doesn't incorporate bacon as a preset side, particularly with their sweet dishes. When asked if the hash browns or grits that accompany the waffles could be switched out for bacon, I've always been told no, not even for an extra charge. And $4.25 is just too extravagant a price for a few strips of bacon.  

Apart from those aspects though, I've always left overly full and overall pleased. 

Pro tip: if visiting on a Sunday at prime time, put your name on the list and walk around the corner for a manicure at Cachet. By the time your nails are drying, you should be getting a text that your table is ready.",1,WIf_ioar0VOT9NXY4EUCzQ

I cannot be the only one with this problem, so maybe they should consider a different ordering method.

Now let me preface this review: these treats are Japanese in style. In general, I find that Asian pastries tend to be a little less sweet, rich and dense. It is its own esthetic that not everyone will be a fan of. So if you're looking for a really gooey chocolate chip cookie or a slice of uber luxurious cheesecake, you'll probably be disappointed. You have been warned.

Ah - what can I say about Suzuya Pastries? 

Hidden behind a quick lube joint, you probably would miss it if you were driving too fast. Limited parking is also an issue due to the numerous shops (a nail salon, the quick lube, etc.) in such a small retail space.

But no matter. A trip to this bakery will take you less than 10 minutes. There really is no place to sit and eat because of the size of the shop (there's two small tables and maybe four chairs in the store). I'd imagine most people get the pastries to go. The selection is small so come earlier before it's all gone.

The time I went, I selected the Mont-Blanc chestnut cake, a kabocha pie and an apricot/almond pie. I did so to sample their two variety of crusts (a shortbread crust, a puff pastry crust) and their sponge. Suffice to say, I was genuinely impressed.

If you could only use one word to describe the Suzuya's pastries it would be this: symphony. They have a precision of flavors and textures that makes every note in your mouth sing. That's right - this place is the Ode to Joy of pastry perfection. It is a marriage of subtle spicing/sweetening (to enhance but not overwhelm the ingredients) and excellent technical skill.

The Mont-Blanc cake is sponge cake layered with pastry cream and chestnut puree. The sponge cake flavor is just right - not too heavy handed on vanilla. With all the pastry cream, it retained a wonderful texture despite all that moisture. Chestnut purees tend to be overly sweet but they were perfect here.

Kabocha pie - what a wonderful idea! It was a Japanese take on pumpkin pie and truly I was floored. What perfection of puff pastry crust! When it comes to pies, it's hard to find a pastry crust that is equally flaky even on the bottom. Well, lo and behold, Suzuya has it down to a science. The filling to pastry to ratio was just right as well. 

Finally, the apricot/almond pie. This was the husband's favorite pastry. A crispy shortbread crust adorned with glazed apricots and moist almond filling. So good and it was the special of the day.

If I have one criticism of this place, it is the prices. The three items I purchased added up to $12-ish. For the price, it would be nice to have a larger portion size for each of the desserts. However, that being said, I have paid way more for dessert elsewhere and received significantly less enjoyment.

Overall, for some amazing Asian pastries, this place is a 5 starred place in my books.",9,h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q

The wait was not too bad, maybe 25 minutes but that is fine because we were not in a hurry. 

The crust was really good, a thin, crispy not too greasy crust, reminds me of Chicago. It is a popular chain in Chicago, am pretty sure they have one in Elgin. Sauce was just right, cheese was very tasty and not too much to overwhelm. Love the square slices. 

Overall I would give this a thumbs up and I would come back. Please see two pics I posted on Yelp.",3,TOrRfYRFuxx0k9HH7OC6pQ

When we were ready to eat, I ordered the chicken supreme with garlic mashed potatoes, vegetables in a  chardonnay lemon butter sauce. Wow, was the chicken ever piping hot. Almost burnt my mouth (I was very hungry and excited). It was moist and tender with the right amount of grill marks. The chardonnay lemon butter sauce was amazing. It gave the dish a nice zip.

There were pumpkins available for purchase but in general the place didn't seem as classically fall and as wonderful or nostalgic as I had hoped it would be.  The cake donuts were delicious and the apples were great too.  The apple fritter was okay.

The atmosphere. It's intimate, with pretty much every square inch of wall space filled with kitschy artwork and memorabilia.

The napkins. Neatly folded in birdlike form with a fork inserted.

The presentation. Food is served in a manner consistent with a much more expensive restaurant.

The menu. Pumpkin Curry! What more need be said?

In all seriousness. I love the food. There is plenty of variety on the menu. Those in search of heat will find it. Those not can find safe refuge. Servers routinely ask for your heat preference on a scale of one to five, with five being hottest. Keep in mind it's an Asian scale. I'd suggest you go no higher than a three, my preference, even it you like your food spicy. Go higher at your own risk.

They will ask you to pay in cash if possible. We paid with a credit card on our most recent visit, without problem or comment. It's just a small business understandably trying to avoid high credit card fees. I'm fine with that if it helps keep their prices reasonable.",2,NwPnvTALYMNZgdiwHHkuAQ

The stellar reviews here are mostly coming from out-of-towners but for local Montrealers, Buona Notte is a bit of parody of itself and the whole ""St.Laurent Street"" scene. See, back in the late 1980s, that area of St. Laurent between Sherbrooke and Pine was where all the most exclusive restos and clubs were, filled to the hilt with the beautiful people, aspiring actresses, models and high-end escorts, places like Business, Mediterraneo or DiSalvio's. Most of them are long-gone now and only Buona Notte still hangs on. Come Formula 1 weekend, you can only book a table at Buona Notte if you agree to the $5000 ""bottling fee""  and its filled with F1 jet-set types and the aforementioned models and escorts-types hoping to make a break. The reek of desperation and posturing and posing is enough to make you lose your meal.

This has a good-looks-and-money entrance policy. If you don't make the cut, you're not getting in and even if you do have a reservation, they'll place you at one of the worse-off tables in the back near the kitchen and no where near the front. I came here once on a date years ago and I remember the waitresses in skimpy super-tight dresses, the wall of signed plates by the likes of Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran-fame or Jerry Lewis. As for the food, it was awful, bland and over-priced beyond belief. When you come to Buona Notte, you're not coming here for the food.

And Dolce Wraps delivers!

What a name. And the font of the sign is so Disney-like, it definitely threw me off. Huh? Middle Eastern food in that place? No way!

And it's cheap too. Double plus.

We ordered the chicken moroccan plate. Oh man. YUM. The meat was cooked well, spiced perfectly, with good rice and salad on the side. We ordered some hummus as well, which was nice and smooth.

But man, the AGLIO (aka garlic sauce). BEST GARLIC SAUCE EVER!! There was one place in Ann Arbor that I liked to frequent for its garlic sauce, but nothing compared to Dolce Wraps- it's like this spicy hot garlic sauce that they give you, on the side, to compliment your food. Oh man, expect bad breath, but if you love garlic...Mmmm...winner!

And the owners were nice. My bf went to ask for a lid for our hummus...the owner asked him to hand him our hummus bowl, and the owner slopped some more hummus in it, and gave us a lid. We were a little flabbergasted- HUH???? haha. It was nice though- what a plus. :)

Chicken and Waffles:  chicken was dry and the skin wasn't as crispy as I like.  The waffles were huge but sort of soft and mushy.  Every bite required a big gulp of milk to wash it down - that dry.

Reasons:
Pros 
This hand down is the best pizza pie in Canada.  The way they cook it, to the toppings, and mickey's sauce...amazing.   If you are lactose intolerant, or super healthy craze...yes you will hate it.  But if you want a real deep dish, greasy, so tasty pizza ...wow so good.
I can't stop saying good things about how tasty this pizza is.

CONS:
this pizza is best had fresh.  But there really is no place to sit, except a ledge and a table.  Summer time they have a few patio chairs outside.  But still...this pizza is best experienced right pipping hot out of the oven.

The big reason for the jump from a previous 5 star to a 3 star....greed.  Yes this pizza is amazing, and i will splurge on it every so often, but after it was featured on TV...the prices sky rocketed.  Yes I believe in price increases are necessary, but overnight the huge price jump is greed.  This place was a local legend, and regulars are what are this place popular through word of mouth, reviews etc.  TV hits, new ppl come in, and boom 30% price jump.

As the second location of Jeon Ju Hyang (the original one is at the Bamburgh Circle plaza), this restaurant was cleaner and better renovated. I came late night ~9pm and only a few tables were seated so it was nice and not too loud. While there was only 1 waitress working at the time, she was attentive and it was never a problem to flag her down when needed. 

Let's start with what I came here for - the side dishes. I'm definitely not going to say that they were the most delicious side dishes I've ever had BUT I was still very content with having that variety and getting to sample all those different flavours! I particularly liked the pickled cucumber and kimchi because they weren't too spicy, perfect for lil' weakling me. 

As a party of 3, we ordered:

Japchae and rice with beef ($12). The rice didn't have enough flavour in my opinion but it was sizzling hot and the overall presentation was visually appealing. Be careful not to touch the pot anywhere (handles included) or you might burn yourself! Learn from my mistakes.

Galbi Tang ($16). The soup broth was nice and savoury and the pieces of short rib were large and tender. I think this would be a great comfort food as it was pipping hot and very satisfying. However, I find the price here to be rather steep.. at other Korean restaurants that make this dish comparably well, it only costs $10~12. 

""Snack Combo"" ($15). So the combo allows you to pick one dish from each of 2 lists, A and B, plus a drink. I chose Gimbap + Jajangmyeon +  Coke but there are many other options for you to choose from. Given the word ""snack"", I assumed they would be giving ""snack-sized"" portions of each of the two dishes but NOPE, they were essentially full-sized dishes and it was quite a hefty amount of food! The gimbap was tasty but a little bland in my opinion so if you eat it with kimchi or other side dishes, it really gives it that additional kick of flavour. The jjangmyeon was alright too, nothing special there.

Not undercooked or overcooked, just cooked perfectly- which by the way even the best of restaurants can't seem to nail. The rest of us carb loving people ordered pasta and weren't at all disappointed. If my husbands comment doesn't put it in perspective, I don't know what does- ""I love you and your lasagna but this is the best lasagna I've ever had.""

If you ever have a bottle of Chianti without these two distinguishing marks- it's not legit. I learnt all of this during a trip to Italy last year, and legit chianti is truly delicious. 


Bottomline, this is the place to go for a traditional Italian experience- from the wine to the food. Reservations recommended.",2,PUQFBO57wiRZRnUOpaiSXw

For example, I have called five times within the last month and a half to have speed enforcement set up in our neighborhood. There are cars constantly running stop signs, vehicles speeding well in excess of 30 mph, tailgating because some vehicles follow the speed limit, and even some idiots driving in the wrong side of the road because they are on their phones. Question: Will it take some child in a bicycle or walking to school to get seriously hurt before we do something about this? I have no vested interest in this since my kids are all adults and have moved out of our house, however this is my neighborhood and have been here twenty one years and enjoy seeing kids play ball on the street, ride their bikes to school, couples walking their dogs daily but their safety is at risk because my concerns keep getting ignored.

To be honest, I was hesitant at first since I always stayed on the strip. I've walked through a few of the downtown hotels and wasn't too sure if I'd like GN.

We arrived at the hotel in the morning and left our luggage at the front desk while we gambled. At noon, we checked to see if a room was ready and were able to check-in. Recommendation: stay in the Gold Tower. It's close to the lobby, pool and front entrances. 

Our room was located on the 6th floor and had a king size bed. The room was clean and came with a keiureg. Everything looked fine (not old and/or dingy). 

If you bring your own k-cups, it's free to use. If you need k-cups, it is $15...If you pay the resort fee, you do get two bottles of water for free as well as wifi for two devices. 

In regard to food: the hotel does have a Starbucks, Claim Jumper, a steak place, the Grotto (Italian food), convenience store and a small snack place.

The pool is something to check out! There is a water slide which slides through a shark tank! It's super cool. If it weren't so cold outside, I'd check it out.

In addition, the property also has a gym.

In regard to transportation. You can self-park or valet. Taxi pick-up and drop off is available at the front of the hotel; however the pickup for Uber/Lyft is at another entrance in Carson tower.

I've been waiting patiently for them to open and am glad they finally did! I have a weak spot for Chinese take out, and always welcome any new places to hopefully add to my rotation. 
I left this morning to find a menu to My House on my doorstep..... I took this as a sign that I HAVE to try this for dinner. I had plenty of time to peruse the menu, and decided on walnut shrimp, green jade vegetables, and crab rangoons.

Here's my verdict on each of my menu items I ordered:

Walnut Shrimp - generous portion! Large shrimp,  lightly  breaded and flavorful on their own. Complimented well by the walnuts and the white sauce. I especially love that this wasnt drenched and drowning in sauce. It allowed for the other flavors to shine through.

Green Jade Vegetables - as you may have guessed it.... this is an entree of green veggies. Green beans, broccoli, snap peas tossed in a white sauce. Again, lightly sauced not soaking in sauce. Very flavorful for a side of veggies, I was pleasantly surprised.

Crab Rangoons - Aahhhh yes, crab rangoons, my guilty pleasure. One of the deciding factors I consider whether I will return to a Chinese  restaurant is how much I like their crab rangoons.  These were top notch. The wonton wrappers were fried perfectly. Light crunch, good texture.... not hard or too chewy. The cream cheese filling was seasoned/ filled with something magical that I thoroughly enjoyed.

Needless to say, I'll be back. I wish this business all the luck. If they keep up with the quality food they served up tonight, they will do extremely well.",4,ewtL3plKywXuLtmFZoUczw

Please, take your money elsewhere.

I was given a gift certificate to get a massage by my boyfriend as I have severe arthritis and I've been wanting to take a day off work to fully relax and enjoy it. When I first called to schedule my appointment, the girl who answered sounded very short and as if she didn't want to be on the phone. 

I told her I was calling to schedule an appointment and she put me down for 2:00. She never asked what I was looking to come in for or even explained anything. This was my first time, so I was unsure what the process was so it was partially my mistake for not asking what the process was and assumed I had to go in and tell them what I wanted.

I arrived 30 minutes early. The greeting I received was awkward but I gave them my name. I was told to have a seat but I was confused about doing so without filling out paperwork so I asked if I was to do so. The girl was like, ""Oh yeah, here you go...""

As I'm filling out the paperwork, I begin to realize that none of the questions seemed to pertain to the service I wanted. At one point, I asked her if I had the correct paperwork but then dismissed it because I saw questions asking about allergies so I figured maybe I was ocerthinking things.... I was utterly confused but did not want to seem like I was nitpicking so I handed over the paperwork and took a seat.

I got called back by a nice woman and she said, ""So is this your first time having a microdermabrasion?"" I immediately let out a ""whoa"" and explained the miscommunication done by the front staff and told her I only wanted a massage and that I didn't even know what a microdermabrasion was, and that I was scheduled for this without being asked what I wanted. 

She looked upset but reassured me we would go to the front desk to get what I wanted. I apologized to her because I felt terrible that she could have had a client for her services but instead, didn't because of what happened! So off to the front desk we go and I explained what the situation was. They apologized and told me to come back at 4 pm for a hot stone massage that I wanted. I was worried at this point and didn't even want to return but I did and wish I had just stayed at home instead.

The massage was okay and the woman who did it tried her best to make me feel relaxed and less tense from my arthritis. I did NOT get the hot stone treatment. Instead I got charged for the hour long massage ($89) and didn't even get the remaining amount left over from the $100 gift certificate. 

To be honest, I don't even want it. After my experience that was supposed to be relaxing, welcoming and stress free, I left trying not to be that rude and upset customer even though I was trying to hold back frustration and tears, and left with the intention of never coming back or recommending this place to anyone!

Went with two other couples and having heard the place was typically busy, we went early-6:00 and planned on putting our name in for a bay and then have dinner while we waited.  This worked our perfectly.   We ordered our food and very shortly after we were done eating, we got the text that our bay was ready.  Note that each player needs to buy a $5 dollar players card which is good forever and is how the game play works.  You load the card with money and swipe it in at your booth.  Make sure what line you are in when you enter so you don't end up standing in a line that you didn't need to be in, they have kiosks for the cards.

So, for the food, surprisingly it was really good.  Between the group, we had a pretty good mix of plates on the table and everyone was really happy with their order.  I had the basic cheeseburger- but there was a cobb salad, club sandwich and a few other dishes- all the main dishes ran about $10 ish.  

The wait staff was on top of all our needs the entire time and let me tell you the place was packed!

Game time- we were in a bay on the second floor and had a couch, there are some bays that have tall tables but I think either would be comfortable for a group.  They did have heaters that you control in your bay if needed-we did not. 

 There are several games you can choose to play, all varying around lighted/colored circles out in the range.  You pay per hour and we played two hours.  The price varies depending on the time of day, for us it was $45 per hour for the bay.  Again, outside the waitstaff was always in the ready and drinks, deserts etc  were delivered quickly and with a smile.  It was so pleasant- good job to TopGolf for training and customer service!! 

Before I sign off- one quick tip- order the  injectable donut holes- yep, creme, raspberry and chocolate- fun and yum!",2,8mujL5ZlIEou7GTA5g29nw

First off, they brought us tea in a pot and this is the first time I get charged for tea at a sushi place. The tea tasted like water. And the soy sauce tasted like water, we had a strong suspicion they water it down. It was horrible. And you really needed the taste of soy sauce to help you out because the rolls themselves tasted so bland. One of the rolls we got I think it was the siren, was basically a salad. A salad without any dressing. Just a bunch of mint leaves and a cm sized shrimp. 
The waiters, although polite, kept hovering around us and made us uncomfortable. Oh and they also charge for ginger and wasabi (it doesn't even come with the specialty rolls order)  they also brought out our sushi two orders at a time instead of all at once which I didn't like. 
Also, each roll was the size of my hand. Please make your rolls smaller and bite size! Don't make it impossible/embarrassing for us to try to chew/choke on it. 
In the end, for three people,  our bill came out to $100. Pretty outrageous for less than mediocre sushi.

The sign touts that they make their own tortillas and are the best. I was looking forward to trying this place, and although I'm not willing to write it off (as I like to try things twice before doing so), I can't say that I was really impressed.
I ordered a chicken burrito with green enchilada sauce inside the burrito as a combo. The burrito itself kind of reminded me of the Patio frozen burritos my dad would have in the freezer as a kid. Now, I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad thing, but there was certainly no wow factor for me. The burrito filling's texture was that of the frozen burrito, although the chicken was very tender and the tortilla was, of course, better than frozen.
As far as the best tortilla I've had? Far from it.
The salsa was the highlight of Carolina's. Very flavorful and I just wanted to put it on everything!
Beans and rice were the usual tasting filler sides.
The atmosphere of this place was very entertaining. You have to speedily grab a table while you can, as this place is packed! Reminiscent of a cafeteria, but just a little dirtier. I didn't mind in the slightest, and I think it added to the ""charm.""

I did my research on the company and did see a couple negative reviews but thought they might be a ""one off"" experience or hard to please customers.  The price was great and about $100 less than the other companies.  YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.  Only ONE bellhop showed up for the job.  The company called me multiple times and said that they were sending someone else while the ONE guy was moving everything out of my building. Eventually another Bellhop did show up..for about 45 minutes.. rushed and stressed me out even more and when I got the bill I saw they charged me for him being there for two hours.

The ONE bellhop that was there from the beginning had one more run to make.  He had dragged my mattress out in the hall way of my apartment building and said he would be right back. When the mover didn't come back after an hour I went to look for him.  The mover and the truck driver were NO WHERE in sight.  My furniture was sitting out on a VERY BUSY road with the truck door open.  The ONE bellhop that showed up JUST UP AND LEFT. My mother and I had to drag my mattress back inside of my apartment and I had to sit outside to make sure no one was stealing literally all of my belongings. During the lull of...an hour..hour and a half...of not knowing where the truck driver was and realizing that the mover just BAILED an ambulance showed up at my apartment building and the truck was blocking the cop and paramedics from the easiest access to the patient. 

Eventually about two hours later the company sent two more bellhops out and they were able to finally finish the job.  It took the company 10 hours to move out of a 600 sq ft studio. The truck was loaded terribly and it looked like the boxes marked fragile were purposely thrown around..they were dented and some of the belongings inside were broken. 

The company charged me for 10 hours of bellhops and 10 hours of moving.  At first they told me they would take off the price of the truck....I refuse to pay for 10 hours of moving when it should have taken three hours AT MOST.  It was not my fault that the company has unreliable employees.  After multiple phone calls and added stress by bill was ""discounted"" and ended up paying way too much for this NIGHTMARE of a move.  

Honestly just look through the reviews...every other review shows an issue or a bell hop not showing up.  Please learn from my experience and hire a different moving company.  It was not worth saving $100 for all the stress and headache I went through.",4,lNCYyiMnTzvA-HY-nFQKLQ

When nothing came I followed up with Mike who referred me to Ester.  Ester told me the quote was going to someone's desk for review and I would have it in a few days.  After another couple week I called again asking if they had anything for me.  I was told one of the employees had some personal issues, they were sorry and would get the quote right over to me.  After another week and a half  I called the sales person, Mike.  I told him normally I would be long gone but I really liked some of the things he said.  I told him if they were not interest in my job to just let me know and I would stop bugging them.  Mike told me that was not the case at all and that he was going to go speak with Ester and would make sure they got the quote right over to me.

Mystere means ""mystery"" in French.

Let me tell you something. Either they did a good job on keeping the mystery of why there was a freakin snail throughout the whole production or I just don't get it.

Whatever.

I love watching Cirque du Soliel shows simply because it makes you FEEL -- whether it be amazement, joy, bliss, wonder.  Everyone's opinions will be different but it evokes a reaction out of you. 

Mystere isn't as mind-blowing as Ka, as artistic as ""O"" or as musically wonderful as LOVE by the Beatles.  But there were lighthearted moments, like when the baby called one of the audiences ""papa"" (and proceeded to call him as papa the WHOLE show!) There were laugh out loud moments -- seriously, who is that obscene man throwing popcorn and spilling bubbly on the audience?!

And there were the classic moments that only a cirque show can provide: the flying trapeze act, the man with the steel cube, the two gymnasts who did a difficult balancing act and challenging poses with each other.

In the end, I stopped trying to figure out what the snail meant and took Mystere just for what it is: a good show.

* check Mirage's website for discounts before buying your tickets. Especially during the summer season where they slash the prices about 40%. Check with your hotel for discounts as well; staying at the Trump gave us a buy 1 get 1 free pass to Mystere*",20,Z88N6qly3Dp5C06XbZ9IMQ

The restaurant is conveniently located in Shops at Don Mills, and the decor is absolutely beautiful. It has a high ceiling and some pillars that provide a very classy, but modern atmosphere.

I visited the restaurant along with three coworkers for lunch on a Friday. My coworker told me that the restaurant is not usually busy, but maybe because it was a Friday, we were not seated immediately (the wait was only about five minutes). Unfortunately, we were unaware that there was a closet for our coats until we saw a server open it and hang a customer's coat after we were already seated for some time. We would have liked it if the server told us about the closet instead of having us find out ourselves.

Overall, the service was great, but the food took a while to arrive. We waited for about 30 minutes for our food. We only had an hour for lunch, so we were pretty tight on time. Make sure that you have plenty of time to sit at the restaurant during a busy Friday period and even reserve a table if possible.

My coworker and I got the Royal Pad Thai. I really liked the presentation of the dish because the pad thai itself is inside an egg wrap. The sweet and sour elements were delicious, but I have had better pad thai at other restaurants before. Linda Modern Thai prides itself of its ""award-winning"" pad thai, but I just didn't think that the flavour justified a high price of $18. Regardless, the noodles tasted great, but I found the chicken a bit dry and hard to chew.

My other coworker got the Tom Yum Goong (hot and sour soup), and she was slightly unimpressed because she was expecting it to be more creamy. Linda serves it with a clear broth, which is a different version of Tom Yum Goong that other restaurants may serve. She also felt that the soup smelled like cleaning supplies, which was not very appetizing. She also got the entree size mango salad, but she wasn't full after eating it.

My fourth coworker got the golden curry with crispy beef. He didn't have any complaints for his curry. In fact, he really enjoyed it. However, he noted that even though he asked for the spiciness level to be the highest, he felt that it was definitely less spicy than Srirarcha sauce.

PJ8VJqsTdJno0beARzaTrQ,2,2016-11-08,1,xsCu9j-1Qe1r2LPOHJUf3A,0.0,"Kintaro Sushi & Hot Pot is an interesting place with quite a bit of potential.  A free standing building in front of Lowes, you would never know that this was recently a Chinese Buffet; they have remodeled the place to look very Asian modern, lots of browns and tans with tiles.  The overall effect is upscale and cool with a nice bit of class.  

While Kintaro has several all you can eat options, it is not a buffet, rather you are served at your table.  I've tried Kintaro several times for the weekday lunch $14.99 all you can eat Sushi and Hibachi.  You are given a single page menu which you check off what you want.  There are a couple of limitations: you eat all of what you order; they will not modify any items and they will limit how much you get at a single time.

I tried a bunch of apps and other hot items, including the teriaki squid, the hibachi shrimp, the spring rolls, shumei and fried squid app.   The Shumei and squid app were both nice and relatively small, nothing special, but nice and the right size so that you are not filled up.  The Teriaki Squid was a larger portion of squid with peppers, onions and brocolli in a decent sauce; the portion size was a bit too big for this type of dining, it will limit how many other items you can try.   The Hibachi  shrimp was a more reasonable size, with a side of fried rice and a nice creamy sauce.  Overall the hot foods are good and well made, but nothing really special.

I have tried quite a number of the sushi items, Nigiri, small rolls and larger rolls.  The sushi menu has actually expanded a bit with them adding a number of items including more types of nigiri sushi.  The sushi was better then the buffets, not as good as the fine Sushi places around town, but good.  The rice to fish ratio is ok, I would prefer a bit less rice but I understand why it probably will not change.  The fish that is used is of good quality.   I was more impressed with the nigiri sushi which tends to showcase the quality of the fish being served, with the Tuna, White Tuna and Smoke Salmon all being very good.  The regular rolls are good, although I would wish that the spicy rolls were a bit spicier.   The large rolls are interesting, but tend towards using tempura frying and sauces to add flavors, rather then letting the flavors of the fish come through.  
  
During my first visit, I had a big issue with service, which was extremely slow, a huge problem when you are doing all you can eat table service.  In addition I did not get all of the items that I ordered each time.  I did talk to the manager who told me that they were short of servers , but even so I was sadly disappointed with the server I had.   On the later trips, they seem to have resolved these issues, with service being much better, with food coming out in a more timely manner.  I also limited the number of items I ordered at a single time so there was no issue with with missing items.

A couple of other notes, all beverages are an additional charge, there are a number of other options available from the all you can eat menu.  There are hot pot options at lunch and dinner.  The sushi options have grown, you will not find anything very exotic here such as soft shell crabs, uni, scallops and the like, which I would love for them to add, but those are expensive items so I understand why they are not on the menu.

The improvements in service, have made Kintaro an excellent option for all you can eat sushi, especially at lunch when you have plenty of time.  Although not cheap you get high quality sushi and other Asian cuisine with good variety.   I have also heard that the hotpot option is very popular, so I will have to give that a try.",5,dD5vTDPzv_79m8_zZhc9hA

Ambiance: Beautiful restaurant but they sure back you in.

Service: Wait staff were amazing. Did their job and explained every dish carefully and were attentive. Although the hostess was an idiot and made us walk back and forth between two restaurants because she was clueless. Maybe that just set the tone for the rest of my dinner... 

Food: This is where it got dodgy. The salad was fresh but the scallop smelled ""fishy"" and that was utterly disappointing. The foie grae was mushy and was presented ""flat"" when it was presented. That was a first. The risotto was tasty with the truffles... very generous portions. Venison was solid... so there were some hits and misses... but I expect more from a restaurant where the seating costs over $125 per person.

First of all, pho was great. we both liked the broth very much. If you are a fan of Saigon noodles on Odana Rd., you would think the portion is smaller than ones at Saigon noodles. 

We ordered two appetizers(egg rolls and spring rolls). I give 3 stars for egg rolls and 4 for spring rolls.

We ordered a combination fried rice for my son but it was not as good as ones at other Asian restaurants. My son is 4 years old and of course he likes fried rice everywhere but he kinda stopped eating at some point. You might like it if you are a big fan of curry flavor.  

The reason why I am giving this restaurant 3 stars in rating is the service. I was very disappointed with the service that my waiter was giving us.

Also - our server did not know ANYTHING about the menu. Her exact words were, ""I don't know anything about the food, I just serve it"". All I asked was if their ravioli were made fresh or frozen, and my fiance' asked if their French fries still had the skin on them. She didn't know the answer to either question, and she didn't offer to go find out.

Thankfully, I avoided the ravioli, but my fiance' ordered the fries anyway... and they came - with skins on.

So I ordered the rib eye, rare... it came perfect. Ordered with it, a bowl of clam chowder (was home-made, yes, but under seasoned & tasted like a cream soup with clams instead of a clam chowder). I took a side of fresh fruit... what I got was 1 slice of pineapple... 2 slices of cantaloupe that were not ripe.. and 2 dried out orange slices... quite depressing.

My fiance' ordered the grilled cheese w/fries - again, fries came with skins on, so she had them sent back and asked for the fruit... she got more pineapple than I did, but her orange slices were dry, and her cantaloupe was not ripened enough.",1,uvmqOhjShM45TafnJaDMfQ

I've been using Epic for about 2 years, after they were referred to me by the AC company I've used for 15 years.   

Epic has never disappointed me.   They handle repairs quickly, efficiently, and cost effectively. 

 I just had them do a job repairing a leak in a cast iron kitchen drain line in an older home.   They told me that they might need to jackhammer out some of the concrete floor to get to expose enough of the pipe to do the repair because the leak was right above the floor.  They told me it would be $850, minimum.   They called me the next day, with the job complete, and news that they had been able to make the repair without jackhammering, so the total cost was only going to be $600.  Considering how hard working with cast iron can be, that's really reasonable.

 Epic plumbing does quality work, at reasonable prices.   They are available 24hrs for emergency calls, but they don't do routine repairs outside of normal business hours, which is understandable.  If you need them though, they will show up, and they'll do a good job for you.  I can't recommend Epic highly enough.",0,Cn7qYxOZHDnjluN0gxnoVQ

So checking to see what was nearby I spotted this place with 4 stars.  And it was just across the street!  So we put the groceries in the trunk and walked over.

From the outside it looks pretty ordinary.  A neon sign tells you that you are there.  It was very crowded when we walked in, but a booth was open so we grabbed it.  Within 10 minutes there were even more people and some had to wait for tables to open up.  I figured this was a good sign.

First impression:  slow service. Dive.  Shabby interior and it took a while to get the menus.

Extensive menu. Lots to choose from.  Which is cool.  It took a while to go through everything.  Even then it took a while for them to take our order.  They probably need a third server, at least during dinner.  The wait was unreasonably long.

Once ordered it took a reasonable time for the food to show up.  At least assuming they are cooking it fresh (which I'm assuming).

The food:  big portions, simple but good flavors

I can't really rave about it.  It was good.  We were all happy with our choices.  Mine was supposed to be spicy (it had the red pepper symbol on the menu), but it really wasn't.  It was still good, though.  Was this ""as good as it gets""?  No.

I could probably go to 4 stars if we hadn't had to wait 20-30 minutes to take our order.  It only took 10 minutes to go over the menu, and they didn't check on us at all until at least 20 minutes.  Food was tasty, and portions were large, but the wait was excessive.",0,YJYFsF4z-C2qODH5HnGXiw

I had 4 criteria for the rental company:
1. I wanted an experienced rental and tour company with a good reputation.  I have heard horror stories about bad rentals on-line, particularly in AZ.
2. I wanted some place with interesting geological features.  Another downside of motorcycling in Chicago is straight, flat roads.  I wanted something interesting to ride on.
3. A place that rented exotic bikes (i.e. something other than Harleys.  Nothing against Harleys, I just wanted to try something different)
4. Something in the $100 or less/day range.  I'm an off-season tourist because I'm looking for a bargain. 

MC Tours met all of these very easily.  They were well reviewed by their past customers (on an admittedly biased ""guestbook"") and it was clear to me that they knew what was up with their very professional and knowledgeable communications.  They were answering my lists of questions I hadn't even asked yet.  

Obviously Arizona's Red Rocks area, along with the Grand Canyon and Tucson Valley make for gorgeous sight seeing, so I knew I was going to have some great destinations, but Monica and Gabor at MC Tours showed me some great roads to travel on that were as much fun as the destination.  

The Bikes at MC Tours were just what I was looking for.  I ended up getting a BMW R1200GS for 6 days, but had other more touring minded options as well as some cruisers.  Triumphs, BMWs, Kawasakis.. Lots of options.  The bikes were immaculate and Gabor gave me a great rundown on what to expect from the bike and how to operate it.  He had the kind of expertise that only comes from having ridden the bike and knowing what it will do.  He wasn't just regurgitating the manual to me.  The bikes came with a disc lock and GIGANTIC saddlebags for no extra charge and had GPS and several other options available.  I personally like the old fashioned paper maps and wasn't doing any off-roading so I skipped the GPS.  

They had a great ""Mileage saver"" option available to me since it was off-season, and even though I went over the miles per day allowance of the cheaper option, the overages still came out to be less than the more expensive unlimited mileage packages.  I certainly wasn't stressing about my mileage or watching the odometer very closely.  I managed to pack in 1200 miles with just about 5 full days of riding and still managed to save $300 over the other options.",4,WtAJV3Ibw5Oz-NE8DIrUWg

Atmosphere: 4/5
Would come back? Yes

This restaurant is owned by a Vietnamese family serving northern-style (Hanoi) pho. Its menu emphasizes the health benefits of pho and uses no MSG, organic broth. 

What I ordered:
1. Pho Vistro (Chicken & Beef Pho) (4.5/5) - a hearty, light broth full of flavour but not too salty. The noodles are thicker than the typical pho noodles you would see at most restaurants - this is unique to Hanoi pho. I would recommend getting this and if it's too mild for you, you could always add hoisin/sriracha. It's around $10 per bowl, so on the pricier end for pho, but well worth it for the higher quality ingredients. I finished the entire bowl including the broth - and it didn't leave me dehydrated and wanting to drink water for the next 5 hours!

2. Chicken Fried Spring Rolls (4/5) - the spring rolls were crispy and tasted authentic. The flavour is on the milder side - you could tell they didn't add too much salt. My only wish is that they had pork spring rolls! 

3. Vietnamese-Style Ribs (4.5/5) - extremely tender and flavourful braised beef, comes with a side of rice and salad. Loved the tangy coleslaw-style salad on the side!

4. Vietnamese-Style Chicken Wings (4/5) - came with 5 wings, these were pretty standard chicken wings. Flavour was just right. 

At the end of my meal, they gave me a loyalty card. I'd definitely come back again for the healthy pho and an even larger side of Salad Vistro!",2,C22Pl7wBn8T3UlXDbHkEig

The spa facilities where I got my vet first massage as it came with one when booking the room, is still to this day one of my faves, one because they had showers, private rooms, great smelling oils, and they sent me home with a pair of sandals, exfoliating gloves, and a super relaxed demeanor!

Sadly, the cupcakes were a bit dry, but I am sure they had to bake in advance to be sure they would have enough for the event.  (And as it turns out they did donate over 600 cupcakes to the event - kudos for supporting such a great cause!  

And, I do need to point out that, I have sampled some of their cupcakes before at another event & those were delicious and not at all dry!  I think it was a mexican chocolate  w/ a little bit of peppery kick -yummo! 

Of the cakes I tried last night, the Red Velvet was the worst - it was really dry and tasteless. The Sweet Tea was slightly dry but had excellent flavor.  The Hummingbird was the best of the night - it definitely was the most flavorful and moist of those that I tried. 

I would definitley like to check out the shop though & get a fresh cupcake.  And I do look forward to watching the Cupcake Wars episode that they won on the Food Network.  (It will run again on Tues Sept 20.)",0,aDYNz8cujkDdmbiOh95ANA

As if the north shore needed another sports apparel store, right?

They have apparel, home decor and gifts for not only the Steelers and Pirates, but also the Penguins, Panthers, Dukes, Nittany Lions, Grays, Crawfords and even the Mountaineers of nearby WV.  If you're a fan of any of those teams then there's something here for you.  In my opinion, everything in these stores are well overpriced.

Two hours later, still no new room key which meant I couldn't even leave my room because I would be locked out!!

The trainers are extremely knowledgeable, very encouraging and very professional. I would have to say one of my favorite things about Mike and Matt is that they push you to go beyond your comfort zone with a positive and encouraging approach, and even better they keep YOU accountable for your success. They give you all the tools you need to accomplish your goals, and remind you that if you trust the process and be accountable for what you do outside of the gym and at home in the kitchen you will absolutely get your results. The trainers are so professional, and very informative. The training classes are amazing. They're challenging, motivating, and you learn so much from each class. They're consistently helping you  improve your form etc on specific workouts so you learn, and incorporating new things to maximize your workouts, and progress with your fitness.  I joined Revolution training to do the 6 week challenge and completed my challenge 2 weeks ago. From the beginning of the 6 week challenge to now, I've lost 7% body fat and 20lbs total! The results I have had personally have exceeded my expectations. I also would like to point out that Revolution Training is home to people in all different walks of fitness. In our group there were  people who were already in shape and wanted to get in even better shape, people who had a background in fitness/sports, but were out of shape and had some weight to lose, and others who've never worked out before and were ready to make a change. It was so amazing seeing everyone making progress and all of us feeling and seeing the change in our bodies. If you are looking for a change in your health, I highly recommend working with the Revolution Training team. Talk with them about what your goals are, and they will help you get there.

I had the grilled char which was fantastic and cooked to perfection. My friends had the fish tacos which I want to try at some point.

1. Great facilities...we chose this over LA Fitness which is closer to our house because we wanted the steam room...
2. Usually no waiting on classes or machines at any time we have been there...
3. Staff is mostly friendly and Club Manager personally spoke with us to help resolve some of the issues below....
4. 2 hot tubs, so one is always open..other clubs seem to close it when I want it most..also  steam and dry sauna are very well maintained...I wish they were coed, but despite being in the locker-room, they require bathing suits anyway so I'm not sure why my wife and I have to split up to go in them...it tends to shorten our use...
5. they have good towel service for no extra cost

Now the negatives:
1.  soap/shower gel in shower area is poor...need a better gel/body wash
2. install ""rain heads"" in at least a few of the showers like 24 hour fitness...
3. locker room is trashed at 5AM..wet towels everywhere on floor...obvious night staff doesn't clean it up
4. there was SO MUCH the membership people didn't tell us during our signup....ASK ABOUT THE SMALL PRINT:
 a.  was given one week guest pass and NOT told guests can't come in till 9am until I got there at 0500 before work!
 b. Was told we could get 50 minute massage for $20 for first 30 days.  Was NOT told you have to AKS for the special NEW BEGINNINGS deal and actually had to cancel a 30 minute $40 massage after we arrived...then we were told that they DIDN""T GIVE THE CHEAPER MASSAGES ON FRIDAY OR SATURDAY AND THEY WERE BOOKING 13 DAYS OUT FOR THOSE......none of which we were told when we called to schedule or when we arrived...very embarrassing.  in Marketing, that's called BAIT AND SWITCH OR FRAUD for short....
 c. Lastly, the FREE MyLTF bucks they promised EXPIRE in 30 days, so we quickly decided to use them for personal training...what we got was a high pressure SALES PITCH that rivaled ANY TIME SHARE PRESENTATION I've ever been to...we walked out after being told we needed to pay for ""advanced VO2 testing, pay for a Nutritionist, and that our 4 free sessions wouldn't be enough to orient my wife with the machines because ""they were used for basic teaching "" and there was too much information she needed to know first before they could get to the workout....we specifically told them we wanted to use all 4 sessions to set up a workout plan for her (we are both experienced gym members and have used training before).  We were again told that what WE wanted would take PAID sessions and then told that OUR GOALS WERE UNREALISTIC AND THAT HE WAS GOING TO SET A MORE REALISTIC GOAL FOR US.  We were also told that the FITNESS TEST, which was offered as a FREE BENEFIT during our signup by our membership coordinator, would COST US ONE TRAINING SESSION...When I argued that that was not the deal they told us, he said ""Well why didn't your membership guy schedule it then?""  We don't have children in swim lessons and with a  30 day expiration date, these MyLTF Bucks are basically worthless to us...the spa is much more expensive than we would use for services like haircuts, nails, etc.  If you just want a gym to work out at, go to this club...if you plan on using services and LIKE HIGH PRESSURE, CANNED USED CAR-TYPE SALES PITCHES go to this club .....

This is a place that you could visit any time of the day or night.  Reminds me of a little coffee shop in downtown Denver that I used to visit.

JMiaNitMzMbJm6Kh0RbT5A,1,2010-07-11,1,9Mol0UkjQD9upWe-R_Nu_Q,0.0,"I heard Canoe was one of the best restaurants in Canada, so I just had to try it.  In addition, Canoe has a focus on regional cuisine, which draws me in like a moth to a flame.  Fortunately, I was already in Toronto :).  After actually dining there, I do hope that Canadian food catches on in Atlanta.  We already have a restaurant called Canoe, so they'll have to call it Rowboat.  Hey, a girl can dream.

Almost every seat in the house is great.  From the 54th floor of the TD Bank Tower building, you can see across the city.  What a sleek, cosmopolitan feel!  This is Toronto from its best angle.  Inside the restaurant, the decor is sophisticated and simple with a warm modern disposition.  

Canoe has a focused menu -- plenty of regional (or at least national) cheeses, seafood, interesting red meats, and seasonal veggies.  Here, the Canadian bent seems to make perfect sense and detracts from nothing.  The platings are just lovely.  One in our group had an octopus dish that was right out of Michel Bras' playbook.  I enjoyed a rather simple fish that was perfectly delicious, though I do regret not splurging for the tasting menu.  Seriously, when the chef has this much artistry and clarity, it's worth it.  Canoe's food was approachable even by those in our group with less of a fine dining focus, which speaks again to the talent and vision of the chef, Anthony Walsh.

Service was attentive and well executed, but most of all, the staff had a genuine attitude of pride towards the food they served.  It was easy to tell from their descriptions and mannerisms that they thought the food was amazing, and I'm sure that contributed to my judgement.

Yes, the food is expensive.  I'm sure the rent and ingredients are too.  At some point, when you're evaluating fine dining, it's art!  I'll always remember this dinner and hope to return for the tasting menu.

So, is Canoe the best restaurant in Canada?  It offers my favorite straight culinary experience in Toronto, with Opus being my actual favorite restaurant.  Restaurants with great views have a tendency to offer mediocure food and become tourist traps, but this is the opposite.  I highly recommend Canoe to both locals and tourists.",6,sZlRgGhDHZojTghW9vkLyg

Basically, this place has two menus - a regular menu and a specials menu.  The regular menu is very brief, and basically consists of - eggs+bacon, eggs+corned beef, and a few croissant sandwiches.  I tried the eggs and corned beef, which tasted decent, but it was nothing to brag about.

The specials menu changes every day and has more unique creations such as open faced omelets, eggs benedicts, fish tacos and a different play on grilled cheese each day.  I tried the fish tacos and thought there was too much cabbage and it was a little bland.  However, I think if eggs benedict had been on the menu when I went, I might have developed a different opinion altogether...

The sauces they give you are both fantastic and the balsamic butter on the steak alone would have made it the best steak I have had in along time.  My wife had the bolognese sauce and loved it.

My eggs were over well, the sausage was great and because it was pancake Tuesday they were only $1 each and money with to the Canada Cancer Society.

After waiting nearly an hour to get our food after we placed our order, our food came out. I would have been willing to give this place 2 or 3 stars if the food was at least half decent, but it wasn't. Our burgers were extremely dry, the chicken satay wraps were tasteless and cold, and my sister's fries were dry and stale. I was hoping that after the long wait, at least our food would be good, but it seemed like it had just been sitting out forever. 

Frozen Hot Chocolate: 
My best advice would be to skip their frozen hot chocolate and instead, go to Godiva and get their frozen Dark Chocolate Decadence shake. It tastes better and costs less than half the price. We got the frozen hot chocolate to go because we wanted to get out of the place. The frozen hot chocolate is good, but definitely not worth $11. Each of us took a few sips and that was all we needed before throwing it away. And trust me, it was not because we were full. 

This was the closest I have ever come to walking out of a restaurant. Our server, Robert or something like that, was probably one of the worst servers I have ever had. My entire family works or has worked in the restaurant/service industry so we usually give servers the benefit of the doubt, but this guy was unacceptable even to our standards. He gave us a bunch of attitude and was not attentive at all. At one point, it was taking so long for our food to come out that my mom asked him to cancel our order. But he told us, ""Oh, but it's right there, I can see it"". I had a direct view of the kitchen and there was nothing on the counter... but we decided to be nice and say ok. Fast forward 15 minutes later... still no food. He intentionally avoided our table during that entire time and was not apologetic at all. I think he may have said sorry once but it was the least genuine and most condescending ""sorry"" I have ever heard.

First the positives, I love the space - amazing decor, huge space, awesome outdoor patio, giant beer board, and the parking is really convenient too. The happy hour is a good deal if you stick to beer - often you can score some great releases for $3 or $4 bucks a pour. 

However, there are quite a few negatives as well. About those beer pours, the UB takes the stance that 1-1.5 inches of head is a good pour. Well that might be fine when we're talking about a pint glass here - but when you leave several inches of space on my 10oz snifter, I'm not going to be happy. I've never complained about bad pours, but for one bartender in particular there, it was ridiculous. The other bartender working actually came by and took my glass back and added to it the last time it happened, apologizing for the bad pour, so I know its not just me here. Another thing that bothered me is that the bad-pour bartender also proceeded to have a conversation at the bar within earshot of my group about how he couldnt wait to get off and head downtown to get wasted at Chase Field. Now, I don't know about you, but I would think discussing plans to get hammered in front of customers wouldnt be acceptable in a nice establishment. 

Now, about the food. The happy hour menu is a complete waste of money - I've ordered a couple items from there and all are very undersized for the price - nothing ""happy"" about that! The mac and cheese came out in a tiny tray and when i saw it, I actually started laughing - probably about 5 bites of food for $7 bucks? It was crazy, I sent that back immediately. On 2 other visits, we've tried to order the parmesean garlic fries with our meals - and both times they came out cold and soggy in a tiny tray. We tried to send them back once, only to receive the same soggy sad excuse for a fry back in return. Steer clear.

Try finding this place at about 2 am is a lot easier, there are tons of post night clubbers, or other late night eaters trying to get their grub on.  You'll most likely see a line into the hall or at least bunches of people scarfing down pizza near the entrance.

As for the the pizza,  it's not like there are crazy weird toppings or anything.  It's just a plain and simple good pizza.  They are constantly baking them so they are coming out hot a fresh.

Esplanade 14: big plush leather seats with a fold out table with so much leg room you should never touch the seat in front of you. And they were thinking large Americans here- No problems for the 300+ pounders. They won't be spilling over into the seat next to them.  These seats rock!...literally

Esplanade 14: one popcorn size 7.50 (free refills and large enough to feed anyone), one drink size (large with free refills). Not a rip off either. 

Typical theatre: $10-$11
Esplanade 14: $13 and probably should cost more. 

Only one negative thing to say:
I don't like the extra butter for my popcorn on the side in a small plastic cup. I don't know how to put it on like the specially trained concessions staff and it's difficult in the dark. The theatre should complete the preparation of the popcorn before it reaches your seat.",2,8Z57x0PSxdk2h2GB71wz7g

Boy am I glad I chose Canaletto! They seated us upstairs in a gorgeous private room! We got our own private waiter, Mauricio, who was wonderful. It was a very private room with a gorgeous view and the food was wonderful. My only complaint was that it was pricey- especially the house wine was $37 a bottle! Yikes. Still worth it, but be ready to spend a pretty penny.",0,8ebQm-Py_UxW73Sc0SlPLg

This place has become our neighborhood takeout Viet. They've installed window treatments since, it's soften the ambiance a bit which was well needed. Also there's a new takeout menu, which is shorter but no less confusing.

Last night we brought home and shared: 
#13 Pho Do Bien ($9) shrimp, squid, fish ball and fish pate. The shrimp was dry but aside from that an excellent, strong flavored Pho, we loved it. 
and
#7 Goi Ngo Sen Tom Thit ($13) Lotus Stem salad w/shrimp and pork.
Very tasty ""salad"", could have used a bit more of the chili/fish sauce in my taste but I'd definitely order it again. I wouldn't want to make a whole meal of it but it's great for sharing as a side - albeit a bit pricey

Not the type of restaurant to take a date to, but it is what is: an oasis in this foodie hell neighborhood.",2,ZvmC522FAwxt8qT1jxqliw

PROS - very clean facility and didn't reek of sweat and other weird gym scents that seep into the drywall (sorry LVAC-Maryland & Karen lol) 
Nice staff , fresh feel , I went around 1 I clock so wasn't to crazy but I can imagine like any other gym to avoid during peak times 5-7pm 
10$ can cancel anytime !

CONS- no indoor track , I don't like treadmills at all. I prefer personal exertion and not being guided by a belt lol

- the ""gymindation"" signs everywhere ( basically saying that you cant make grunting noises or drop weight or wear string tank tops because it can make members feel uncomfortable ?! That's the cheesiest corniest crap I have heard. The rules are kinda ridiculous. So if your striving to become the next Jay Cutler STAY AWAY FROM THIS GYM THEY WONT WELCOME YOU LOL. At the end of the day some one will always be better than you in the gym, whether they run faster , can complete more reps or just overall in better shape. It's up to you as the individual to strive to set your own fitness goals and to not worry about strangers inside the gym . (Just my opinion)


I would have given it 4 stars if it wasn't for those silly signs lol.
I will return tho their non contract beats LVAC any day",2,EzjLARgz3Jmb4L1t3lBy1A

I lived in South Korea twice and have eaten at countless old restaurants while I was there, and this place reminded me of those places. The layout wasn't as authentic as I expected, but they still had the grill at the table and the food was spot on. I'll definitely be going back!!",0,bR4CbA6qBy6kEqazMWALBw
