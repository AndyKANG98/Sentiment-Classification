I have had my blonde highlights done by Ina on and off for a few years. I was always very happy with the results, yet I was kept trying to look for a more reasonably priced place because it is very expensive indeed (in my case about $300 with the toner and blow dry, which is not included).

And so it was that a month before my wedding I went to a very reputable downtown salon (supposedly the best in to) to have my highlights done. To make a very long and painful story short, my hair was butchered, orange, brassy, horrible. I did actually cry...so I went to Ina, to see if she could do anything to fix it, and she did. It was a very, very! long process; she put in new highlights and once the foils were in brushed with darker dye the rest of my hair, strand my strand...the result was absolutely amazing.

The bottom line is: she is good. She knows what to mix to get an ashy shade, she knows what will match your skin tone, she knows how thick/ think the highlights should be, where they should be...so I have decided that I would rather have my hair highlighted twice a year rather than every 3 months, but go to Ina rather than hopelessly keep trying to find a colorist that knows what they are doing.",4,2QsIQuJC_c9IgE0QxOJwiw

I had been going to a salon in the mall for about a year and I noticed that my hair was getting extremely dry. I used some products that they recommended but nothing seemed to help.
A friend recommended Sara D so I made an appointment with her hoping that she would be able to make some suggestions for my dry and damaged hair. She suggested one product and gave me tips for drying and styling that would help. Since that first visit, my hair has come along way. Sara always gives me suggestions for keeping my hair healthy and she'll recommend different products in the store but never pushes me to purchase a product. She always asks what my budget is and what I'm looking to have done so that I'm not disappointed with the outcome. I'd highly recommend Sara - or any of the other stylists.",2,kz8Bxh4Azss6hINcRRwOEg

After we came home from dinner I got out my box they smelled amazing but the strawberry was mushy and already sitting in liquid.  By Saturday morning they were mushy, soggy, messy strawberries sitting in over 70% liquid, just a large not edible mess.  I tried calling on Sumday and got hung up on over and over again.  On Monday I finally got a person on the phone.  I was told there was no manager available.  I explained the issue and she told me sorry you must of got a bad box.  She offered to replace the strawberries, but at this point I didn't want more strawberries concerned I would get more of the same.  I asked if I could get either bananas, pineapple or apples.  They had a box for less money with a mix of strawberries, bananas and pineapple, which I was interested in.  She explained they had been so busy over the weekend they had NO fruit.  This was after 12 in the afternoon, surely they should have gotten a delivery and if not for emergencies run to the grocery store right next door.  I said it didn't have to be today but I guess they never expected another delivery of fruit ever again.  She said the only thing she could do was refund the person who paid which was my mother in law.  I hung up and called my mother in law and told her I loved her idea but they were horrible and they would be contacting her for info so they could refund her.  It's now five days later and no one has called her for the refund and I never got anything edible.  They are liars and thieves.

They were all so nice and orderly, I have never experienced that at a music venue.

Most of my previous review still stands, but I definitely had a wonderful experience which is why I give this 5/5. This is not your typical, fast paced restaurant. The chef really makes each meal from scratch and alone, so yes, your meal in a bigger group or depending what you order may come out first before the others. It's definitely a homey feel. You really need to have patience if you want to eat here. For my experience, I thought the pace was great since we ordered lots!

I made a 7pm reservation for Friday, and when I arrived only a table of 6 were in the restaurant. The server was really kind, and she gave us her recommendations. I had called in advance to ask for 2 orders of the lobster risotto, since I had a few colleagues rave about it recently and thought I just had to try. We also ordered caprese salad, fried calamari, linguine alla vongole - clams in white wine pesto sauce, spaghetti and meatballs, as well as the mushroom gnocchi. Yes - this many dishes shared between 4 people. We started with bread, as well as an app on the house (grilled zucchini with squash on top). Everything was delicious. I would prefer to try the grilled calamari next time though. In terms of the lobster risotto, it's not a traditional risotto but made in tomato sauce. If you love lobster, this dish or the lobster pasta is your ideal meal. It comes with a whole lobster! I would also recommend the linguine with clams, and the mushroom gnocchi was so delicious. Tasted fresh, and full of flavour.

At the end of our meal, the Chef also gave us creme brulee on the house - also the best creme brulee I've ever had. Just the perfect crust, and the dessert itself wasn't overly sweet. I'll definitely be back and hopefully it would take me a year to do so. This place is a gem!",1,Tjv5bBtJ-Z_CLiY-rheG2g

ITS IN YOUR BEST INTEREST TO AT LEAST OBTAIN 2 OR 3 ESTIMATES PRIOR TO USING PARKER AND SONS. IT WILL SAVE YOU FROM HAVING TO WRITE REVIEWS LIKE THIS.

I went to Home Depot last weekend to purchase two Rheem water heaters. I was advised that Parker and Sons was the company used to install Home Depot water heaters. The technician came to my house this morning, conducted a 5 minute walk through of both existing water heaters then spent 20 minutes in his truck writing an estimate. The estimate was $5,538! When I asked the technician how in the world the price could be so high, he responded, ""that's our pricing on """"our"""" water heaters. I told him this estimate was set up by Home Depot not Parker and Sons. He continued to tell me the pricing was for Parker and Sons water heaters. The water heater from Home Depot was $850 each, how could Parker and Sons charge an additional approx. $2,000 per unit to install? They said it was to bring my current water heater up to code and pull a permit.  I called the city of Scottsdale and they informed me the only cost that would be needed was a water pressure valve ($14) and a permit ($44). The remaining items on my current units are up to code and would easily pass in inspection. Parker and Sons pays it's technicians commission for every job they are on. They will try to increase the price to receive that commission. This is a predatory business practice. Just look at all the reviews on Parker and Sons, they are almost all based on being mislead and over charged.

UPDATE: Angie, please read my entire review prior to responding next time. My main complaint isn't just pricing. I called this estimate through Home Depot to purchase a water heater from Home Depot. The technician quoted me a Parker and Sons water heater based on Parker and Sons pricing, not Home Depot pricing. There is no need to have a supervisor call me. I've already spoken with Paul Kelly, owner of Parker and Sons this morning.  I will leave our conversation of the review but I can assure everyone reading this review that I addressed my concern regarding the technician and company of this predatory business practice. He assured me he will investigate and follow up with me. 

UPDATE: I just received an estimate to install from Huntington Home Improvement for $750, all parts and haul away of both old units included.",8,I8zSO_iKzCZgdJ0CtY42Yw

Located in Uptown, it is definitely an experience to go eat here.  Both birthday dinner times were with a large crowd 8-10 and we had reservations.  Once everyone arrived, we were promptly sat at our table and the servers got our drink orders and food orders.  The chef/entertainer comes out and confirms all our orders and then starts cooking right in front of us.

I'm a sucker for showmanship, but the chefs pull out all the tricks:  flaming onion volcano, fake ketchup bottle squirting, etc.  Probably the funnest thing is when the chef offers everyone some sake and proceeds to squirt the sake in peoples mouths until they had enough.  This latest visit was the entire table catching broccoli in their mouths...

Our 2nd time here, we had a very curt and unfriendly waiter who forgot to refill drinks, forgot cutlery, mixed up orders and finally delivered ice cream that was inexplicably savory.

This is an all you can eat and cook Korean style restaurant where you order your raw proteins, cook on the burner in your table and enjoy.  You might imagine that you can begin to enjoy cooking unless you have utensils but our waiter, constantly running between tables, had this annoying reply to our requests ""I will get it later, ok?""

Food quality was mixed. The beef and short ribs were good. The sushi was fast and seemingly well prepared. There was a white fish that disintegrated into a mush when cooked - we suspected it had gone bad. Little shot glass servings of ice cream - you have a choice of mango or green tea - were presented to us without spoons (later, ok?) and ended up spit-out-savory as in ""what the hell kind of ice cream was that?""

Our meal concluded with a bill that included a 10% service charge which our waiter explained went to the restaurant but that he would only get whatever we tipped him. Wtf? I've been to restaurants that automatically add a tip to parties of 6 or more but the waiter doesn't ask for another cut.

The decoration and atmosphere was very cute and bright. I really enjoy going to nail salons that are welcoming and bright. 
I went during my lunch break asking if they could take me in. I didn't have to wait which was a major plus since I only had a hour break. 
They offer a lot of different varieties of color and shades! 
The service itself is great, but the execution was done poorly. I'm usually not very picky when it comes to people doing my nails. However, I felt like I was doing my own nails. The gel wasn't painted evenly and I have random extra paint on some nails. 
When I was done I noticed a part of my nail wasn't even painted. When I told them they quickly apologized and offered to fix it. Usually my gel manicures cost $35 without tip, but they only charge $30 for a basic gel manicure. I rather spend an extra five dollars for a better job.

It was better than my Grandma's recipe straight from Italy.  That is saying a lot. Next I split  two dinners with my Father because we could not decide. The Virgina Spots(Sea Bass) were outstanding. Small portion but I was expecting that when you order spots.  My Dad got the Veal special with 2 large shrimp. My Dad doesn't eat shrimp so it was a bonus for me.  They were cooked in some sort of light red sauce. I don't remember what it was called. It seemed to be a mix between tomato and Marsala. Not sure what the veal was like because my Dad did not share, which is unusual for him. The only reason for the 4 stars is the food took forever to come out.

For add-ins, the wasabi honey is my favorite. It's just a hint of heat and sweetness, although the sandwich is good alone. Also, I am a fan of their fries and coleslaw. The fries are thin, shoe-string type and they are crispy on the outside and mashed potato-y on the inside, and not so greasy. I am usually not a fan of coleslaw mostly because I do not like mayo, but this coleslaw was pretty good!

I went after it was open for only 4 days, and my meal was excellent but not quite perfect. I am pretty picky at expensive restaurants, and none of the minor flaws were things that would prevent me from returning. I had the hamachi crudo with crispy potatoes -- if each bite had a little of every garnish (especially the tiny lightly spicy pepper) it was delicate and delicious. But if the bite missed any of the many small elements on the dish, then it lacked seasoning. I also had manila clams which were delicious, light with a wonderful broth -- but there was a little grit in the broth. And I also had a half order of agnolotti with a pea sauce with shaved truffles. The flavor was absolutely out of this world, but it arrived at the same time as the clams, and the truffle was too strong to eat alongside the light clams.The housemade pasta was a little TOO al dente for my taste, but I understand that many chefs believe in leaving a ""bite"" to noodles and risotto that isn't to my taste. I was concerned the pasta would get cold if I ate it last, but it was just fine. So, a small plate, an antipasti and a 1/2 primi plus a nice glass of white wine ran me $70 with tip.

In some ways they were met and in others they fell short although perhaps as they work out the kinks things will improve.

The good - an interesting array of pettable and viewable creatures from clown fish to sea horses, sting rays to sharks.  you can feed and pet the sharks, rays and some of the bigger fish. There are also some birds and snakes.  It is very interesting and there are nine different feeding stations.  We bought a season pass but if you want to feed, you have to buy feed tokens for extra. Still, it is pretty affordable.

The kinks - very little signage exists explaining the exhibits.  Several glass enclosures had no descriptions.  I really hoped it would include more information about the creatures.

Also, it is very difficult to see some of the creatures due to the opacity of the water, unless they swim right by.

Finally, it has only been open just over a month but some of the exhibits are empty.

I hope they fix these problems because this is a great experience for the kids and adults alike.",13,wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw

I'm a huge fan of the two main Chase restaurants and return regularly. I had high expectations for Fin as I hoped it would serve as a new work lunch stop. Sadly... It disappoints.

First I had the grilled Mahi Mahi sandwich. These trendy black buns appear to be all the rage in Japan but they are incredibly dry and tasteless. A McDonalds bun would be tastier.  The fish was good and fresh. That said, I prefer the grilled Mahi Mahi at Buster's Sea Cove in the Market. Equally fresh but a bigger portion and a few bucks cheaper. 

I also tried the Seared Tuna - same story as the Mahi Mahi. Salads are not bad but are served with too much dressing. I recommend asking for it on the side. 

Portions are on the small side and your fish, side and a drink will cost $20. 

Service was good but the lunch crowd was light on both my visits. Your food is ready in about 5-7 minutes. They have a number of bar tables to eat on but not a chair / bar stool in sight. And the heat is blasting. Not very enjoyable to eat in the restaurant. 

No real reason to make this a destination for lunch / dinner. I will stick with the main two restaurants. Not sure Fin will have long term success. I'm sure I represent their exact target market but they missed the mark in my opinion.

Toppings were copious and cheese was plentiful but the pizza was very soggy and the toppings fell off in large chunks. The closest comparison would be a grocery store made pizza which you have to take home and bake yourself. The pizza crust was thick like texas toast and the sauce was absent of flavour.

My coworker demanded I give it a second try, so he brought left over pizza to the office. I warmed up my slice in the toaster oven and chowed down. The pizza was less soggy this time but I felt like it was inferior to frozen pizza.

In certain situations there is nothing you crave more than a good BJs. Another review compared it to Chilis and that comparison is probably pretty apt but I think of it more as a cheese cake factory- they don't really specialize in anything (food wise)-they have an enormous menu with a bunch of diverse options, none of which knock your socks off but all of which are passable.BJs is a great compromise spot when trying to negotiate a meal with a large group- it has something for everyone .


All that being said we all know what we really love about BJs- the pizookie. If it wasn't for this dessert no one would have heard of this restaurant/it would of gone the way of the dodo. The pizookie is a skillet cookie Sunday that you can get in a bunch of different flavors- both cookie and ice cream. They even have a sampler pizookie that comes with 3 different cookie and ice cream combinations so you can get a variety. However, for the discerning foodie the only real option is the white chocolate macadamia nut one- the cookie comes not quite baked through, very soft and gooey in the middle. This means the white chocolate will be basically molten (be careful you don't burn 1/2 your face off Harvey Dent style by shoveling it in too fast... I know from experience) and though the whole cookie itself is soft the nuts will give you that crunch for textural contrast that is so key.

Well here it was, 9pm on a Friday night and wanting something quick and close to the house to grab a bite.  

From the moment I walked in the door I had roughly 10 ""wow"" moments.  From the way they transformed what used to be a sandwich shop into a cute and quaint Japanese spot to every single dish, my mild expectations were pleasantly blown out of the water every few minutes.

I started with a simple salad.  The kind waitress was eager to explain all dishes which arrived and I found that to be a nice touch.   She explained that the dressing was homemade and made of Yuzu, which was apropos.   I know I've had yuzu dressing before and this one was tangier and tasted better than I'm used to which set it apart from the standard Japanese side salad I'm accustomed to.  Next was the Miso soup.  My version which was part of some sort of combo with one of our entrees (add $3 to any entree gets you salad, soup, and rice) did not come with Tofu, but my friend that accompanied me ordered one a la carte which comes with tofu.   Ironically enough she hates tofu and I love it, so we switched.  The tofu was fantastic, which I might be wrong in assuming is their handmade Zaru tofu.  If it was not homemade, it definitely fooled me.  At this point in most Japanese restaurants I've eaten the salad and miso soup just because they're there, but here at Yuzu they felt like important components to the meal.   

Next our entrees started arriving, and first was the Kobe Beef Aburi.  Perfectly seared and with these little garlic chips which complemented it wonderfully.  I also received my side of rice around this time and I know you'll just think I'm pulling your leg at this point, but even the rice seemed a step above.  To make sure I hadn't accidentally ingested something laced with pot on the drive over, I had my friend try it and she confirmed that it did taste better than ""just rice"".   This is a master at work in the kitchen.

Next up was one of our standard orders of Yellowtail jalapeno.  The fish melted in my mouth and the flavor was spectacular.  I did think that the jalapenos were a little too small and didn't provide the kick that I normally like, but it was still delectable.  Our last entree was the Salmon Foil Broil, which is boiled with several veggies.   Good god was this delicious.  The salmon just fell apart and had a great flavor especially when combined with the veggies it'd been broiled with.   ""Wow"" was muttered for approximately the 8th time.   

I decided I had to have the yuzu sorbet because at this point I was convinced everything was going to taste munchies-esque good.   I was right!   Being lactose intolerant I cannot resist sorbet, and the yuzu flavor was perfect.   The waitress also brought out a complimentary order of their soy milk pudding.  I'm not a huge fan of soy milk, but this one was light enough in the soy flavor and  topped with whipped cream which always helps.   I enjoyed it even though I had to pop a lactaid pill to do so.   

The final wow was brought on by the arrival of the bill.   All those fantastic dishes came out to a total of $48 or so after tax.   I even had to do the obligatory ""on the strip that would have cost $100 and been worth every penny"" comment.",5,v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g

2eqoYgA2FK11oavsryNSBA,0,2017-12-09 09:24:38,0,Y4UyTm4tOQW8fhFDamPm2A,5,"If I could give Steve 10 stars, I would. I called him at 11pm to schedule a 4:30am pickup the next morning. Though it was really a last minute thing, Steve was polite and professional and said he was available, took down my number and said he'd be there at 4:30. Now, I've taken enough taxis in Chicago to know that often, especially with big taxi companies, taxis aren't there to pick you up when they say they will. I wasn't sure - would he show up on time? Would he show up at all? 4:30 is pretty early in the morning. If he didn't show, or was late, I was going to miss my shuttle up to Midway and it was for work - I couldn't miss my flight. 

Well, I didn't have to worry. Not only did Steve show up, he was early (didn't charge me for that, of course). His taxi was incredibly clean and fresher than probably any car I've been in, including my own. Steve himself was personable as well as professional. He was also very knowledgeable about the area and knew exactly where my shuttle would arrive at the station. 

But here's what impressed me the most. We got to the shuttle stop and the shuttle hadn't arrived yet, so he stayed with me to make sure I got on the shuttle safely, at no charge for his time. He explained he wouldn't feel right dropping someone off in the dark without knowing they got to their destination or next transfer safely. Then, it turned out my shuttle was full! I asked him if he went all the way to Midway. He said yes, but that honestly to go that distance, there were some cheaper options. He actually even brainstormed with me about other options in the area! He stayed there to make sure I wouldn't be stranded, as I tried to figure out if any of those other options would work. When it turned out they wouldn't, he offer to lower his rate so that I could have one more option - it was still more expensive than Uber would have been (slightly - maybe about a total $30 difference), but I was glad to do it as by then I knew I trusted him as an individual. As a woman going all the way to Midway by myself that early in the morning, I didn't want to take my chances with some random Uber driver who might not be a safe driver or a safe person. It was a great ride there - good conversation (he's a super interesting guy and easy to talk to without being in-your-face chatty) and he's a safe driver (unlike the last Uber I took when I was traveling, that tailgated and zoomed in and out of lanes so quickly that I was sick the whole day after).  

TL;DR: Definitely go with Steve of Executive Taxi if you want to ride in a clean vehicle, with a professional, caring, conscientious driver. I was so impressed by his honesty and integrity, generosity, and caring. He is also just a really cool person to talk to if you are going on a long ride. Also, I found out talking to Steve that he basically IS Executive Taxi, so if you call you're going to get only him or, if he has an emergency and can't make it, one of two other trusted affiliates. He doesn't farm out to dozens of other taxi services, thankfully.

I'll always be thankful I went with Executive Taxi for my 4:30am travel fiasco, because he turned it into such a positive experience. Thanks again Steve for saving the day for me!",0,RAcQIj-LUI0Fz1KXN241hA

1) Because it's the best drinking spot with variety and low prices near my house. Proximity is important. 
2) They have an extensive outdoor seating area so on nice evenings it is perfect. They also have some yard games. 
3) It's just a very laid back environment. The bar staff is helpful and friendly. You can bring food with you and no one is going to make a stink about it (a friend and I showed up with a pizza, not a word). 
4) To reiterate the prices you can't beat. 
5) ANNND the variety is insane. For beer they have a room temp area to choose from, and you can throw it in their chiller. Or they have a fridge of already chilled beer (smaller selection), as well as several options on tap. Then, if you're more of a wine enthusiast, they have a decent selection of wine as well.

I suggest skipping the Bellagio buffet all together and heading over to the Wynn - a better buffet splurge (even though it's $5 or so cheaper). See my review for more info.

For one, tuna should be a bright red and translucent, like how red gelatin looks like. The consistency of fresh sashimi should be firm but not spongy. Fresh salmon, should glisten more. As a rule, the duller the color, the more spongy consistency; the lower the quality. Cleveland suffers from being far from the ocean. Sushi suffers a bit especially in the winter months.

With all that criteria laid out, and having had sushi in Asia as a frame of reference; Pacific East and Shuhei; have the freshest sashimi-grade fish one can find in Cleveland. I order sashimi in places like this. In lesser places I go for rolls and drown it in the sauces to compensate - not here. Sushi rock is good too -- but the quality is the same as Pacific East but at a much higher price. All the good places use authentic short-grain Japanese rice -- watch out for places that try to pull a fast one with substitutes to this kind of rice.

One of my favorite non-sushi dishes is Unagi Don and Shrimp tempura.

Sushi here can't ever be as good as sushi in coastal areas and in Asia, but I'm giving it 4 stars because, all things considered, this is the best in Cleveland.

I ordered the ribeye tacos and they looked good, but the meat tasted awful, was super thin and cut up into very small chunks with a bad taste to it and even the tortilla tasted bad.  The fresh avocado was a nice touch, but this dish was a total fail!

My wife went with a mix of tacos. She said the barbacoa was very oily and could have used salt, chicken was very peppery and tasted like it came out of a bag and like be hated the ribeye.

The kids meals that come with a drink and side which is cool. We got quesadillas and unfortunately they were not good. The kids did not eat them and said they tasted bad. Sampling them to see what was up, my wife and I both agreed they were super super salty. $7 x 2 fail on the kids meals.

My son got $10 nachos with no sour cream.  Then when it came it had no beans and sour cream and when I told them that this was not what context (very politely) they argued with me and said I never said no sour cream and I said no beans. My son and I both were pretty clear at the register no sour and perhaps they heard no beans. The nachos were awful! The cheese wiz with peppery chicken that tasted like it was pulled out of a bag. The chips were very greasy and really did not work for nachos. This was an epic fail and I am very surprised this place has such good reviews considering everything we had was bad.",9,5ECtmLzrurE0RcNpmTwXaA

The restaurant itself is quite small and the wait can be long, but the hostess is super friendly and the line moves fast. Once at your table, the menu itself is very simple and everything tastes great. The restaurant itself is quite noisy and during the summer, the shutters at the front are open which gives the place a nice airy ambiance.

The Khao Soi (see above) is excellent and can be ordered to your preferred spice level. We also tried the squash fritters which were very tasty.

Some of the small dishes had only 2 pieces! For $10-ish dollars, I think that's a bit ridiculous. I simply couldn't afford to eat here with more than one or two people, because that adds up quickly. 

I love the interior of this restaurant. It is a pleasant place to be! I especially love the patio, although it was closed the last time I was there.

Maybe I'm picky but, in the past, there was pretty much only one person who was able to cut my hair the way I liked. Unfortunately the place became so busy that it was too difficult to get appointments and I ended up moving away as well.

Therefore the search for a good, relatively reasonably priced hair stylist began, and Toronto (the city I'm from) generally came up short.

I was in Cleveland for a bit on business and was in desperate need of a haircut. I decided to bite the bullet and get one before I got back to Toronto to see if I could get some luck in Cleveland. It turned out to be a great decision as it is one of the best cuts I have received so far.

I was lucky to get a same day appointment with Melissa, presumably since she had  cancellation. I would greatly recommend her for men with thick hair or asian type hair as she really knows what she is doing. I was able to tell her the general idea of what I wanted and got good input on styling recommendations.

Overall the haircut was above my expectations. Melissa did a great job and gave me exactly what I requested. For full disclosure, upon coming home I can see a couple of spots where it could have been improved but on an overall basis, I am really happy because it is clear that this cut will be able to keep its shape as it grows. Another plus: she even washed my hair after the cut saving me a shower when I got home.

If a $25-30 cut is within your budget I would strongly recommend going to Eddy's on Coventry and I would personally recommend Melissa",1,gW1l1Ubn4CcKjeJ1fR74aw

No menu, no idea what there is to order when the guy asks what I want.  I remember that there were fries with feta cheese and balsamic vinegar, interesting, so I order those and the guy suggests the Pep Pep.  

Now I wait.  I understand that it's freshly prepared, or so says the sign next to me, but come on if you are going to do a drive-thru the service needs to be speedy.  The order takes so long, I'm asked to pull up so the guy can get the order from the 1 car behind me.  Really?!  If it takes so long to make the micro burger and fries with goo on it how are you ever going to make a profit? 

The guy finally brings my food and I drive away.  I get home excited to try something new.  The slider is dripping grease (so much for gourmet) overly covered in some orangish sauce that tastes like Thousand Island minus the relish, the meat patty is half burned.  At least the sandwich was still warm.

Now for the fries, feta and balsamic on fries sounded like an appetizer from a super fancy restaurant.  I'd love to say they were amazing and made up for the crummy $3 slider, but when I opened my fries they were covered in the same disgusting sauce as the slider, bland caramelized onions (how these had no flavor I'm not sure), plastic cheddar cheese that had congealed beyond edible (how the cheese could be hardened and the fries still relatively hot is beyond me) and bacon.

I say this, even after we had a misunderstanding with the restaurant and the front counter of the Orleans. But.... it really wasn't the restaurant's fault. Allow me to explain, we were given a food comp from The Orleans for $50. This was part of the hotel package that we received. We had put down a cash deposit for our stay... we did not use a credit card for this trip. Well, when we tried to use our food credit at the restaurant, the restaurant initially tried to charge it to the room.  After we had already departed from the restaurant, the restaurant realized that because there was no credit card on file, they could not charge it to the room so they called the front desk. An employee at the front desk who really did not know her job too well, told them that they had to figure it out so the employee of the restaurant actually called the hotel room, at 2 a.m! So both employees at this point had made mistakes, but the mistakes were each based on the fact that there are not proper procedures in place for when a guest checks in with cash as a deposit, and is receiving a comp. Eventually, after my wife spoke to a more well-versed employee at the front counter the entire situation was figured out. The restaurant, apologized for the employee calling the room at such a late hour, the restaurant offered us a free dinner for the misunderstanding, and the server actually came to our table personally, and apologized profusely.  The manager on duty was very polite and very accommodating to us. And we were very thankful to him.

We had breakfast and dinner here the same day, so the prices differ extremely between the two.

Breakfast is dim sum style, we had a table of 8, and ate roughly $300 with a bag of leftovers.

The dinner comes in sets of meal that matches up with suggested serving sizes from 2 up to 12 people. The prices start at around $300 and up to $1700.
We had a set of lobster and crab meal, for 8 people, the set itself was around $800. We ordered other dishes and wine, the bill came up to be about $900. The meal was very filling and there were still lots of left overs, we ended up packing up 2 bags.

- Sushi: There are 4 choices of sushi. Average, but at least you do have the option to order it at a KBBQ.

- Seafood:  Calamari, tiliapia, shrimp and mussels.

- Side dishes: As mentioned, the kim chi is surprisingly tasty. You're also offered tofu, bean sprouts, seaweed.

Of course, order the rice. I don't know how anyone can go through all that sodium/fat without blending that taste.

Chako is a good choice for group outings, though it can get quite packed during Friday and Saturday nights. Service start to be much slower and inconsistent: multiple attempts to re-order dishes that never showed up, or to change the BBQ plate, or to clear some of the dishes away. So it can get quite frustrating.",1,lPIsKQYt-md1i3s9CKFZdw

I don't get this place. Given how they advertise themselves on IG, I came in here thinking this was more of a bakery with a few drinks here and there. But nope, it's apparently the other way around. Cafe 86 is more of a boba/coffee shop with a few pastries. I don't know about you guys, but I came here to try their pastries.. and 2 out of the 3 times I have gone there, they barely had anything left. If you're going to heavily advertise your pastries everywhere on social media, maybe you should focus on having them readily available.

First visit, they had no pastries available.. and we came around 3pm. Since we were already there, we decided to go ahead and try a drink. I asked the cashier what she recommended, and she said that the Ube Monster was popular - so thats what I ordered. I guess it's supposed to be like a Ube and Cookies&Cream milkshake. I hated it. It had very little Ube flavor and just tasted like milk. The cookies weren't even throughout the whole drink. All they did was put some cookies at the bottom of the cup, and on top. Pretty lame. Super disappointing and do not recommend. 

2nd visit, they had only ube truffles available.. and we came around 5pm. We also did the Yelp check-in for a free Hibiscus Cooler. The ube truffle had good ube flavor, but the texture wasn't to my liking. My toddler ended up eating it all though. The Hibiscus Cooler was pretty terrible - it literally tasted like water. Another disappointing visit.

3rd and final visit, we came in around 11am and was finally able to try the Ube Leche Flan Cupcakes. We also ordered the Mermaid Drink with Boba (Sea Salt Green Tea), an Ube Truffle, and got the free Hibiscus Cooler again (hoping it wouldn't be watery like last time). Was super excited to try the cupcakes, since that was what this place is known for.. but was pretty let down. The cupcake was hard and dense! I felt like I was eating play-doh or something. I'm sorry, but that's not how a cupcake should be. The only saving grace was the flan, but even that was just okay. We ended up just eating the flan and tossing the ""cupcakes"" away. Both drinks we got tasted watered down yet again, and the boba had no flavor. Yet another disappointing visit.

Also, what is up with the the theme of this place? It's all over the place. It's like they just took everything they like and threw it all together, even though it makes no sense at all. Star Wars, cars, Filipino sun, mermaid drink, _____ monster drinks, zebra drink? It doesn't make sense.

Cafe 86 is just all hype. It's sad, because I love me some good pastries. Such a shame!

TL;DR - They seldom have the pastries available that they widely advertise. Pastries are not as great as everyone makes it seem, and the drinks are just bad. 

Tip: If you want their pastries, go right when they open. If you want drinks, go to Brew Tea Bar.",7,sDjxEhVVwvVYFYv1rOFUfA

Tried this place with my family after the June 2012 write-up in Phoenix Magazine.  The restaurant was a little odd to find and the mandatory valet was interesting, but the interior is amazing.  The person(s) who did the building and interior design did a superb job-- the spot is very open, the revealed kitchen is fun (especially for an interested 4 year-old), and the artistic touches and lighting fit perfectly.  Not often I take notice of these kinds of things, but this is an exceptional concept place that way.

We tried the Chef's Board, Burrata Alla Panna (asparagus), Mafaldine (rock shrimp and long noodles), Margherita pizza, and buttered noodles. All were very good, though not remarkable.  Bread is for-charge and the water has an ""interesting"" taste.

The most offending thing was the flies.  We're talking lots of them.  And big ones.  And so persistent you might as well pull them up a chair and plate.  

When your little kid asks why there are so many flies an why they have red stripes and such big eyes, something went awry.  A kid should not notice the exoskeletonal features of insects at a nice restaurant.  Odd to constantly brush the flies away, just look around to see every other table doing the same.  It proved to b a sad, asynchronous dance for would-be happy diners.  We skipped dessert just to get away from the bothersome diptera.  If only the service staff was as attentive!

Waitress was middling at best.  Drinks were left unfilled for long periods.  Two plates came out too hot while the pizza was just warm-- our daughter's dish came out so hot that she would have burnt her mouth had my wife not tested first (and singed her tongue).  I also had to ask if there were specials because it wasn't volunteered... Maybe specials are a private and fabulous secret, here.  I didn't order the special soup, so not sure if it was indeed nirvana.

Would visit again if there was reason, but my wife and I agreed walking out that it wouldn't be worth a trip on its own.",5,aOAqs5leMNiPSbszvE-_Cw

They even provided a move-in van free of charge saving us time and money! Desert Storage is the cleanest, most accessible storage facility (air-conditioned park-in loading bay) we've seen. Since we were storing some boxes and furniture during the Summer months we wanted a unit that was air conditioned, and after shopping around we found their prices very reasonable.

I've been doing my own taxes with TT for the last 5 years.  After learning that H&R offers a second look tax review from your taxes filed the previous year, I decided to put them to the test to review my 2015 tax filing. Based on my experience, I would entrust them with my new tax filing for year 2016 since now I don't have the time to work on that.  Boy, did they fail the test.

In October 2016 I dropped off two binders corresponding to my taxes filed in 2014 and 2015.  They were supposed to check 2015 only, but the tax consultant asked me to leave also 2014 in case she needed to reference to that year to clarify something.  After two months of not hearing anything from her, I sent her an email and she informed me that she had been transferred to another office and my binders had been assigned to another agent.  The new agent never contacted me, never did anything on my taxes and when I stopped by H&R she did not know where the binders were. After some looking around, she found them.  I reported that to my original agent and she contacted the office manager about my problem.

I went online and, after reading the profiles of the agents in that office, I chose one with vast real estate experience since I own rental properties.  Subsequently, the office manager, without my consent or authorization, removed her name and re-assigned me to Claudia Melissa Argueta, now Claudia Melissa Bozic.  Being that it was a referral from the manager and she was aware of what I needed, I trusted her judgment and went along with her choice.  BAD CHOICE!

Claudia Melissa Bozic received my binders on December 2 and by the end of February 2017 she had not done the review.

On January 11, 2017, I sent her a follow up email to see how things were going with the tax review. She did not respond to my email.   Afraid that she had left the office, like the first tax consultant did, I personally went to H&R. She was there, we spoke briefly and she said that she was working on the tax review.

Not having heard anything from her, I was very disappointed about the tremendous amount of time she was taking to do a review.  I am not a tax person and I can do my taxes in a week.  On February 21, 2017, I wrote her an emailed  expressing my disappointment and requesting the return of my binders.  

The email was undeliverable.  Claudia Melissa Bozic had changed her email address and didn't have the courtesy of notifying me. She was the one who said when I met her that she preferred communication via email.

I needed my binders urgently since I was in the process of refinancing one of my properties and the bank needed my tax documents.  I called H&R and Claudia Melissa Bozic was in California and no one could find my binders in the office.

I requested to speak with the office manager and they finally found my binders after much inconvenience caused to me.

In summary, since October 2016 to February 2017, this office did NOTHING.  Just wasted my time and caused aggravation that I didn't need.  It's a free service, ok, but if they are not going to do the job, please do not offer the service and disrespect people's time.

Due to my bad experience, I do not recommend H&R Block.",1,avis77imGr5t1EyCdppxUQ

I don't want gas for my truck, I need gas for my truck. 

Eating bbq doesn't qualify as a want, but it is a need.

My truck runs just as efficiently dirty as it does clean. 
But I did hit a bird and squashed a couple of rabbits last month, so a wash and detail is kind of a need at the moment.

A savage blowjob is also a need, I think. Or maybe it's a want, who knows.

We've struggled to find good Mexican food in Madison. La Mestiza will not satisfy your need for a giant burrito or tacos - it's not the traditional Mexican restaurant you find in America with combination plates. La Mestiza serves a relatively small menu composed of dishes highlighting the traditional regional cuisines of Mexico. 

The dishes are a little bit pricey, but you get everything you expect in a pricey meal. The presentation is gorgeous, and the food is fresh and delicious. I personally recommend the enchiladas pollo con mole - their traditonal Oaxacan mole sauce is phenomenal, with all the subtle nuttiness and rich chocolate flavors I pray for when I order mole. We've ordered specials as well as the carne asada, and they all elicited ""ooo""s and ""aahhh""s. They have an excellent house margarita and a couple of Mexican draft beers.

The restaurant is very small, but cozy and pleasant. This is a casual restaurant that attracts a wide variety of people. The decor is inviting and comfortable, with interesting artwork hanging on the walls and paper cut-outs strung from the ceiling in a playful, un-tacky sort of way. Do come here to eat at a table - the bar only has a couple of chairs and seems to be intended only for people who are waiting for their take-out orders.

When we were first seated, we were served water in tall skinny glasses & seasoned popcorn in tiny buckets, very cute & unique.

We ordered 6 items and shared: Singapore Greens & Nutty Popeye (salads), Hodgepodge (a tower of fried treats), Diablo Eggs, Elote (a corn on the cob dish that I didn't try), and Smokey Poke.

Menu Link:
http://www.noshandswig.com/nosh%20and%20swig%20menu.pdf

The salads were served in mason jars with the dressing on the side.  The jars are so you can shake the salad with dressing; clever.  Both were tasty though the Singapore Greens need a protein to round out the flavor profile, IMO. 

The Hodgepodge consisted of pomme frites, tempura sweet potato,
truffle tots, & onion rings.  I liked the truffle tots, but a little overboard on the truffle oil & salt.  The presentation is a twisted & tiered tower; I posted a picture

The Diablo Egss are deviled eggs (obviously), pretty regular, a little on the salty side; there is a recurring theme, appearing here.

The elote was grilled corn in garlic butter with cayenne & topped with cilantro pesto.  I didn't try, sorry.

Finally the Smokey Poke; little ahi tuna blocks in citrus ponzu, garnished with norichips & some type of fried squash or potato slices.  Great presentation & flavor, but SALTY...

Ok, I broke down our food, now for service.  It was feast or famine: repeat visits in a short period of time or no one for many tens of minutes.  They were trying hard, I could tell, but they didn't appear to have any type of ""table visit rotation"" procedure. The waitstaff was friendly, regardless.

Finally, ambiance.  There were cute touches, like the sign for the bathrooms was a street sign called ""Flushing Avenue"", clever.  Decorations were sparse and the feel, to me, was that of a hipster automat.  I didn't mind it, but it also doesn't stand out.

I am hoping that all these issues are due to its relative age.  I will definitely try here again though it is FAR from my regular stomping grounds.  Great ideas & concepts, but spotty execution is my overall impression.  Oh, yeah, and salt.",0,K2-KRkqecWxmwqPHQWVZbA

This is one of those ""you have to experience it for yourself"" type of places.  Five stars doesn't even scratch the surface of what type of service and accommodations you will receive when you spend your day here.  My mom and I decided to spend a full day and sample as much as we could possibly fit in... with some downtime in between services.  Booking appointments with the concierge - wonderful, informative, and top notch.  Arrive and check-in - fabulous.  This is the only spa I have been to where they have you complete a full health intake form - VERY MUCH appreciated.  All while you enjoy delicious hot tea, a cool cloth, and the removal of your shoes to be replaced with spa sandals.  The spa attendants were WONDERFUL and incredibly attentive.  Fresh tea, cold water, explanations of the facility... very thorough.

Mom and I started with the day with a Hammam treatment.  What a delight for the senses.  Firm, soft, hot, cold, warm... One of the most incredible treatments I have ever experienced.  I couldn't stop touching my legs for two days after - I was so silky, it was insane.  If you do ONE thing at The Spa - try the Hammam.  A total delight for the senses.

The Jade Enzyme facial was incredible and relaxing.  The Detox Foot Treatment was also incredible.  All of it.  Amazing.  I didn't even get to excessively use the facilities as I had originally intended... next time.  I spent most of my time relaxing on the warmed tiled loungers overlooking LV Boulevard or nestled up in the cozy beds in the relaxation room with a cup of hot tea and a bottle of ice water.

Next time I go back, I will be booking the Time Ritual... two hours and fifty minutes of treatments customized specifically for my body's needs that day?  Oh heck yes!  Scrub me, rub me, make me melt!  I cannot wait to return!

As for the prices and the three lines of tips... get over it and show the people that make this place so wonderful a little respect... or don't come here for service.  These folks are working at one of the, if not THE best spa in Vegas and certainly command the prices that you will pay.  They are working very hard to make sure that you get your money's worth and I am a firm believer in gratuity that is commensurate with that effort.  So if you get a little sticker shock... head up strip to a different spa.  Tip rant off.

All in all and magical experience.  Worth every dollar and then some.  Looking forward to going back in a few months and trying a few different services.

If you don't want to valet, park in the Aria self-park and walk over to the Mandarin.  It is a surprisingly short and easy walk... when you arrive at the hotel, you take the elevator to the 23rd floor and then take the guest elevators down to the 8th floor.  It is a bit of an adventure, but plan for a little extra time just in case.  The hotel itself is also gorgeous and I hear that their high tea in their tea lounge is not to be missed.  Adding that to my 'next time' list!",13,nQYP01FewC4UpVG24TTRmw

I am not sure what the hype is about kobe beef and sushi, it was about 26 bucks for 5 pieces which is simply not worth it.

There was several of us there and I was definitely looking forward to having a good time since i'm a big fan of dive bars. I arrived and most everyone was already there enjoying their drinks. I waited about 15 minutes before I asked someone if we even had a waitress.... My buddy told me there was only 1 waitress/bartender working. After another 5 min I decided to just go to her at the bar. As I was getting up she was heading our way. She explained that this was her first day back from not bartending for a few years and she was the only one scheduled for another hour and a half. This made me change my game plane and I started ordering 2 beers so I wouldn't have to wait for a refill quickly. I gotta say for it just being her she hustled the best she could and I give her props, however, management should have known Friday nights gets busy and they should have at least had a waitress scheduled. It wasn't really right for the employee or the customer to have to deal with this. 

I ordered a burger with green chile and continued my 2 beer orders and that went rather well... The burger took a long time, im guessing a little over 30 minutes. I was a little frustrated with that but the burger was actually really good. I asked for some condiments and never got them, im sure it was because the waitress/bartender was slammed so I wasn't too worried about it. 

After awhile a waitress and another bartender showed up to take over and everything started running a lot more smoothly. Beers were flowing, shots were going down smooth, and we got our ordered items quickly. Around 8pm Karaoke started and it was on!!! I chose a couple songs and handed them to the DJ... I was told my songs weren't available.... I gave him a couple more and nope.... So if your planning to Karaoke make sure your gonna stick to the same ol same ol songs... Thunder Rolls, Baby got back, Grease, or a balls song. The DJ offered me to pay for songs I wanted to sing. I was going to tip him anyway so I paid the 2 dollars for 1 of my songs. Sang the song and dipped... Overall its a pretty chill bar, manager screwed the one waitress hopefully that doesn't become a pattern on Friday nights.

If we could have done what we needed done at the UPS store, we would have instead of coming here.  Let me expand.

We came in and of course there was a line with only 2 people behind the counter and one guy walking around trying to look busy..  We were there to do a door to door mailer which he even came over as soon as we came in and confirmed with us.  After about 5 minutes of standing in line, this guy came over and started pulling people with only one piece of business over to another counter.  

As he took some from the back of the line and some from in front of us, we eventually moved to be second in line.  The lady who was first had 5 packages to send out and said she was passed over 3 times.  She finally got called to the counter and we moved to be first in line, our time now nearing 30 minutes.  

After standing there for another 5 minuites, this guy trying to look busy finally came over and told us to come to his counter.  Our transaction with him took less then 3 minutes.  

So, IF ANYONE AT THE USPS READS THIS....If you have a floater, they should take the next person in line and help them if they can, not pick and choose who you want to help and when you run out of options then help the person you have been skipping over and over and over....You want to know why you are loosing business, because of employees like this....",5,kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw

When I got to the window they said that because I was honest and called about the drinks that they would take care of the order and I didn't have to pay for it. My heart seriously melted ..not because of the money but because of the act of kindness from these 2 specific girls (I should have gotten their name.) it was seriously the nicest thing that has happened to me in a long time.

Nowadays we only tend to go there for the occasional single item (a small cole slaw or Snacker), as we don't think they'll get it right.

I think the management of this location needs to impart on their staff that many folks come to KFC to get meals for their entire families.

Despite the crowd on the street, it was not really busy - which is a shame, because the places in the casinos are either much more expensive or not as good food.  It helped that our waitress was very nice and attentive.

I definitely recommend it.",0,u-vUz3rzNTfGNSJ2GKNH9A

I honestly am really unsure why this place got the good reviews it did. It looks okay when you walk in, modern decor, clean setting. But both mine and my partners food were very, very unsatisfying. I ordered home fries, two eggs over-medium, whole wheat toast and coffee. The only thing cooked to order was the home fries- but the ketchup they gave us was over a year expired. Yuck? My eggs were heavily salt and peppered and over-hard, my toast wasn't even toasted. It was just slightly warm bread. And our coffees were a sickly sweet hazelnut, which neither of us had asked for. We both left disappointed and unsatisfied and walked to the Starbucks down the street to get ""better"" coffee. 
The service was okay, though it was unclear if we pay at the register or the table, since our order was taken at the table but there was a sign saying you were supposed to order at the register. Confusing. I wouldn't recommend.",0,s9AmplNvAk2dr092Z7YAHw

I ate there for lunch and dinner and shared a total of 6 dishes. I suggest the Corned Beef Reuben with Sauerkraut and Swiss on Rye with Potato Salad for $15 if you want a good deli style sandwich. The Fish of the Day (Halibut) with Wild Mushrooms and Pearl Onions, Creamy Corn Puree and Tomato Fondue for $31 was also very good. For salads, I thought the Chopped Vegetable Salad with Feta Cheese, Garlic Croutons and Creamy Greek Dressing was very good and can easily be shared with people as an appetizer.

The portions vary between the dishes. I thought the Ricotta Gnocchi with Sweet Fennel-Sausage Bolognese for $23 was a little on the small side compared to the Sweet Pea and Goat Cheese Filled Tortellini with Wild Mushrooms and Parmesan Reggiano for $25. You also can't go wrong with the Grilled Prime Burger with Vermont Cheddar and Smoked Onion Marmalade for $18. 

The Crab cakes were delicious, $17 for 4 crab cakes. When comparing Wolfgang Puck's prices to other MGM restaurants, this place is very reasonable and the servers provided excellent service both times I dined. Nice atmosphere too. I would go eat here again.",2,s7zs8Q-X9eK6KT3HsmCEPQ

I got there right at 9am, supposedly when they open, and I watched as the employees sat around on the counters and chatted in what seemed to be a staff meeting. It was freezing outside and considering it was 9am I was expecting the door to open any minute. 

I waited and I waited. I watched as one by one, the employees noticed me standing outside, and one by one, they peeked their heads around and just stared. You'd think someone would have come to my rescue, but nope. They just continued sitting around on the counters and occasionally looking back to see if I was still there. 

I finally got inside at 9:10am (which SUCKS because by this point, I'm late for work) and I told them I had to return an item. The assistant manager said ""Malcolm will help you on the other side"". So i walked around to the other side and I stood at the cash register waiting as Malcolm tried to figure out how to put his 'Winners' apron on. Finally, Malcolm looks at my item and says ""You're returning this? You cut off the tags"". I'm like ""Yeah, but I bought it 12 hours ago and it doesn't say on the receipt anything about keeping the tags on"". He lost it on me. He angrily pointed to this sign that Winners has that states their policy. He's all like ""You cut off the tags! You're not supposed to cut off the tags. We don't return items with the tags cut off."" Finally he said ""Fine, this ONE time, I'll do it, but never again"". He was BY FAR one of the rudest people I have ever dealt a minute after opening. 

Finally he finished punching away at the register, shoved the receipt and cash on the counter and completely ignored me. I grabbed it and left the store immediately. 

I will never, not EVER, step foot inside this Winners again. Their service is atrocious and I urge all my fellow Yelpers to pick any place to shop but this one.",5,Wx7cbLDqYEL3_aVZwh82Ww

This was my first experience with Flemings and it won't be my last! 
The padres and I came here for an early dinner on a Sunday. When we arrived, we had the restaurant to our selves and settled in on our second table (my mom didn't like the first one) which was a comfy horseshoe shaped booth in the corner. I perused the wine list, which is on one of those fancy iPads, and choose a yummy Zinfandel that appeared before me in no time! 

I was trying to eat healthy and started with the Fleming's salad (candied walnuts and  cranberries!) and then had the New Bedford Scallops that were perfectly cooked and accompanied with a delicious lemon-honey glaze (my mouth is salavating as I write this). My mom was super boring and I honestly dont remember what she ordered, but she enjoyed it. My Dad, however, loved his dish that they only serve one day a week. On Sunday's they offer a prime rib special that includes a appetizer salad, two sides, and a dessert...you need to come on Sundays. This was one of the best prime ribs he as ever in the 35+ years he has been living in Arizona. For his/my sides he ordered the sautéed mushrooms and the BLUE CHEESE mashed potatoes! Everything was incredibly tasty and I still had my Dad's dessert to devour! 

For dessert, my Dad ordered the Carrot cake, BUT, my mom mentioned earlier that I was recently engaged and in addition to the carrot cake (which was amazing, the spice was so delicious and the cake itself was incredibly fresh and moist) we got to indulge in the super gooey Chocolate melted volcano cake (I couldn't stop eating the creamy center filled with chocolate sauce and I am NOT a chocolate person), the refreshing Pistachio ice cream with a yummy tuile (that's a fancy name for a buttery walffald/cookie/cone, thanks Andrea for helping me with my ""classy"" lessons), and, my favorite, the light, yet dense creme brulle...ugh, so good! Oh, and since they knew I was watching my figure, we also got to try their house made whipped cream that you could eat as a dessert on its own!

The food was fantastic and the serivce...more fantastical (even when the restaurant started to fell up)! From the friendly hostess who greeted us, to Adam, the server's assistant, to the BEST WAITRESS EVER, Andrea, and even the manager, Jessica, all were extremely friendly and really seemed to care about how our dining experience turned out.

The restaurant is beautiful, so many different things to look at, watching the food being prepared, of course people watching. For the most part the staff was friendly and accommodating, maybe a bit too stuffy for such a fun restaurant.
We both had a bourbon we had never tried while we perused the menu and made our choices. 
We're both huge steak fans and the scent of charred steak permeated the air, so we agreed to share a Rib eye from Rosewood Texas, recommended by our server.  We shared the Classic Tartare to start, it was good but I've had better and I think I prefer it with toast as opposed to the soft rolls they served it with, it's that texture thing that would've helped. We eventually got our steak, oh baby! Again it was good, but I've had better, actually at a few places, if you have meat in your name, you better serve the best meat I've ever had! 
We shared some sides of Catalan Spinach which I loved...the flavor combos were perfect! Then we couldn't pass up the Robuchon potatoes that are described as butter, butter, more butter and some potatoes. So smooth and creamy, the first few bites are extraordinary you don't want to stop eating them but then you feel that your mouth is just coated in butter and no matter what you eat, it can not be cleansed. Ick! I craved something like lemon sorbet but alas nothing even close to it on the menu, so we got Ten Little Pieces Dessert to share and take some home for later. They were tasty morsels, just nothing to rave about.

After a very long week of work which ended in a very long Friday, my husband and I wanted a quick and painless dinner so after seeing a coupon in one of the weekly mailers (the mailers that usually sit on the counter until the coupons are expired) we decided to run out for a ""buy one get one free"" bowl of noodles.

We both ordered the rice noodles with peanut sauce and split some pot stickers.  The service was fantastic.  The cashier was very nice without being saccharine even offering to explain the menu and ordering process.  The restaurant was impeccably clean with a sanitation score of 101.5 and not a spot of dirt anywhere.  Even the back of house (although there is really no back of the house as the kitchen is fully visible) was shiny and orderly.  Someone on staff was cleaning the entire time we were there. 

After we grabbed our drinks and sat down a server/bus person brought out our pot stickers.  We ate a couple and then started on the noodles.   The noodle portion was enormous with a flavorful homemade sauce and fresh vegetables.  A must have is the Key Lime pie.  It has a great crust and although the flavor is obviously key lime the creamy pie does not leave you with a perpetual pucker.

We noticed that they also offer homemade cotton candy for the kids which along with the other very kid friendly menu options, non-smoking atmosphere, unobtrusive music and pleasant lack of TVs' makes this a very family friendly restaurant.

All of that aside it was the customer service and attention to detail that made our experience truly remarkable.  The owner of the establishment was present and working at closing on a Friday night.  He takes pride in his restaurant and has obviously passed that on to his employees.  It is really refreshing to know that a business owner cares. 

Thank you Todd and the rest of the staff at Nothing but Noodles for an unexpected pleasure.  You really turned what was supposed to be a quick bit to eat into a great evening out.",0,TN2tgE6KxNWleIqEJjPqtA

However, the real reason I love the Grand Concourse is their Sunday brunch buffet. It's ridiculous- rooms and rooms of delicious foods, literally a feast to end all feasts. Omelet bar, pancakes, waffles, and French toast made in front of you, a carving station, every kind of breakfast food you could dream of, pastries on pastries, and so much more. Everything tastes amazing, and you will not go hungry or want of food- you might even get some exercise walking from room to room to find all of the different choices.

You've read enough about their waffles....they're the best, blah blah blah.... mm so good, blah blah.... BUT IT'S TRUE!!!!! They are so light, perfect amount of sweetness and their SYRUP is SO AWESOME. Wow, I think I conveyed my craving and excitement enough - sorry caps lock police. They also offer a cornish hen for brunch - which is a treat. Any place you can have something a little fancier/different with your standard eggs brunch is superb in my books.

But, do you know what the best part of LPD is?! The fact that I can order a savoury and sweet brunch in one plate. E.g. eggs benny with waffles! I honestly could not ask for more from a breakfast establishment.

(I think I'll go here this weekend...)

It's true, the lines are ridiculous. I've swung by at prime brunch hour and the line was long enough to make me turn around and go to an alternative, but the line at 2pm - 2:30pm is bearable (just watch out, they close around 3). With that said, however, the wait time could change rapidly, obviously depending on the patrons inside. It's a gamble (odds being most likely long), but worth it.

I confess this wasn't my first choice. My heat stopped working on our first night of temperatures in the 30s. In the morning I started calling all of YELP's top rated companies. I left voicemail after voicemail then called J & K - not yet rated. Julio (owner) picked up the phone and promised to come the same day. I crossed my fingers and hoped all would work out. 

He found the pilot light had gone out. Didn't charge me, but I asked him to come back and do routine maintenance - including replacing my filters and also insulting the outside water pipe to my home (he does plumbing too.) His charge? $60 for everything including all materials.

But what really set J & K apart from the several companies that have serviced my heating, cooling and plumbing needs before is instead of using his knowledge and expertise to get me to spend more money - he told me I didn't have to spend as much as before.

So I made another appointment for him to repair some plumbing problems I have in my master bath - the same problems I had repaired in my 2nd bath. I paid close to $700 for those repairs - Julio quoted $120, including materials and labor.

I will report if my future experience differs from these, but I'm thinking this is a homeowner's dream - competent, no attitude, priced honestly, licensed professional. Now if he just did all the other kinds of house repairs I need done....",1,CTATUS9blIS5ULqxkQfQgg

The space is awesome, the vibe is inviting and definitely feels like the kind of place I want in my hood. The only room for improvement is some of the bread are kind of dry. I would definitely suggest they work on that. For example matcha red bean was super dry. But some of the other bread such as the sweet taro bun was moist and lightly sweetened. I also loved the bacon twist bread. It went perfectly with my dinner and I can forsee me buying lots and lots of it in the future. 

Grand opening is on 9/17 but the place was packed when I went on the soft opening earlier in the week. It's currently cash only but hopefully they will setup the machines soon.

Stopped in yesterday and ordered the smoked pork belly buns and Tonkotsu ramen. First, the pork belly rolls didn't have a spongy light texture, they were closer to a biscuit texture than a roll. The pork itself was nothing to write home about - most of the fat was rendered off causing it to be quite dry. The ramen is only as good as the broth that comprises its base. Futo's didn't have that silky unctuous flavor of a protein meat base, more like bone soup. The ramen noodles and mushrooms were the bright spots.

He was very knowledgeable, answered all my dumb questions without making me feel like an idiot and bottom line i walked out of there with a little less money and alot happier. i have now been back multiple times for juice, advise and just to hang out and bs and every time its the same. greeted as soon as i enter the door no matter how busy he is and they make you feel like you are old friends.

For those of you who have not been to a Japanese BBQ, think of those AYCE Korean BBQ places, but with better cuts of meats that are individually laid out on a tray rather than plopped in a bowl.  

I arrived earlier than my group, so I sat at the bar for a beer.  The happy hour was $2.50 draft beers and I took full advantage of it!  Our group sat at a booth - they've designed the restaurant to maximize booth space, cause you know, no one likes to sit close to a stranger.  They also air vents built right into the grill, so all the smoke gets sucked out before it even floats upwards.  Now, while you won't go home reeking of smoke, you also won't get the delightful smells of BBQ here as well.  

We ordered two of their group sets, which I love.  It takes the work of picking the individual meats and sides out of my hands.  Food just magically appears!

FILIPINO MUNCHIES
Although it doesn't taste like you've slipped into a Filipino family's kitchen and dined in secret on their creations, our desserts were still satisfying especially with the hot sun melting us outside. There was a slight chemical aftertaste in our selections--a small reminder this restaurant was in the business of making mass-produced, similar goodies in other locations. My Taho and our hot items didn't look very appealing in its disposable container--it looked like a rushed job of grabbing to-go containers from a birthday party.

GLANCING AROUND
Our cashier was very friendly, but with so many bodies dancing behind the counter, it was no surprise to witness some confusion in the interactions between the employees and the customers before and after my order. The dining area is very simple and plain--reminiscent of the old, old fast food places before they decided to upgrade.

I am pretty stingy with doling out stars, but this place is worth every star. Why can't it be downtown, closer home so I can go every week?

The place is not very spacious, so I made reservations and we were promptly seated by a pleasant hostess. The menu is well picked, the flavors are huuuge,and the food presentation is great! The hostess doubles up as a server so at times the service can be a tad slow but totally worth the wait.

We started off with fritters, and boy was I surprised! The fritters came in casings made of pappadoms and were garnished with a smattering of sauces and salts. The complimentary mango salsa is a take home worthy product! So good!

My dining partner ordered the vegetarian sampler which had a grilled cauliflower, a cheese dumpling aka kofta and delicious lentils! I ordered the non vegetarian platter which had jumbo shrimp cooked three different ways: grilled, in coconut sauce and in mustard. Each prep was so different from the other and so, so good. The combination of traditional spices in non traditional ways resulted in uniformly great flavors.

We weren't sure about ordering dessert cuz we were stuffed at this point, but the server gave us a complementary dessert platter which had cheese cake made out of cottage cheese(very decadent and I've never had this before); blueberries, and gelato ( I think). The ensuing food coma was one of the best I've ever had.

I ordered the Ultimate breakfast because I wanted pancakes badly and all the other breakfast staples. 

I sent the eggs back twice. I ordered over medium and both times they were less cooked than over easy. 

The breakfast potatoes were soggy when they should've been crisp. Definitely taken out of a warming tray. 

The pancakes which was the whole reason we came here were tough! I couldn't cut thru them with a fork and i had to stop eating after 1 bite because chewing the hard shell was too much for me. 

Coffee was only refilled once. For a breakfast that costs $30, I expect it to be fresh. And I got something less than that.

Thankfully, I only have one prescription I have to deal with and just have to go by once a month. But, on that monthly trip I'm immediately irritated if I go inside. Generally I'm the only person at the Rx counter and there are 2-4 employees working. No one acknowledges you for at least 1-2 minutes; it's like they have a timer and can't speak before it goes off. Then, all they say is ""Be right with you"".  When someone does finally ask your name they dig through, find your Rx, make you sign the insurance book and cash you out with no more words. It's really amazing how little communication goes on.

You know the hotel is absolutely horrible when the people that work there laugh about how many complaints they get and say that the hotel (that employs them) sucks.

I've been half a dozen or more times since I moved to Pitt and Piccolo Forno has never disappointed me. If you've never been before, at least one person at your party should order the marscapone y speck pizza to share with the group. It is simply delightful.

Portions are extremely reasonable- I'm a normal sized, younger man and I'll eat 6/8 slices at dinner and not leave hungry. Prices feel extremely low (13-15) for a pizza of such insanely high quality. BYOB makes this place the highest value restaurant I can think of. 

The only downside of the restaurant is that they do not take reservations. They will, however, call you so what I've always done- either in a group of 2, 3, 4, or 6, is to place the reservation and head across the street to round corner cantina to enjoy a drink while we wait. I recommend you do the same as the wait will often be 30-50 minutes if you arrive during prime time.",0,7XNsl3BQ7CpoNSr4H9nIuA

We ate here for dinner both nights we were in town. The majority of the meals ordered were the 3 taco plates. One carne asada, marinated pork, and carnitas, served with yummy rice and beans- the tortillas were very good too. This is definitely the plate to get here. I think that the carne asada ones were the best. 
Normally we order all of our food medium spiced, but beware of the red hot sauce that they put on the tacos. My daughter somehow got an extra dose on her tacos and was having a hard time getting through the burn.

Pros:
- bigger & better organized than most
- has the most helpful (and generous with samples!) beauty consultants
- postal office staff are great too (something you know is a rare occurrence if you go to the other locations nearby)
- rarely run out of sale items, a frequent occurrence at the smaller locations
- a large food section makes it a good spot to stock up on staples (milk is cheaper here than at the supermarket)
- they sell TTC tokens

Cons:
-  I'm not a fan of the pharmacy because a) the pharmacist isn't very knowledgeable about things like supplements and non-prescription items and b) it's overpriced (but that's not a location specific complaint - all Shoppers are).",1,MkAGikFT9ffLGvyuoTjUWQ

I always worked with George the Manager who is now no longer there unfortunately. George was always great, helpful, friendly and seemed to be very honest in what repairs needed to be done.

I took my car there last week for an oil and filter change. I dropped off my car with Mike who was not friendly at all, seemed pre-occupied with whatever other work he was doing and I felt like he truly wasn't listening to me when I talked to him about what I needed done.

When I picked up my car, I spoke to Scott who was at least a bit nicer and he went through and explained what their suggestions were for future car repairs and the pricing but I still didn't get a great feeling from him that I would be taken care. I had my breaks done there sometime back so it will be time to get them replaced soon and since they are on a lifetime warranty, all I would need to pay for is the labor which he said would be $60. Since he quoted me a price last week, I naturally thought that information would be saved in the computer system for when I was ready to get it worked on. 

Today, I called to confirm the price and make an appointment to take my car in. Mike answered and at first quoted me $139.99. I then said that Scott had quoted me a different amount. Mike then quoted me $70.00. I again said that that was not the amount Scott had quoted me. At that time, he asked what Scott had quoted me and I told him $60.00. He said if Scott quoted me that then they'd honor it. What I don't understand is, why wasn't Scott's original quote already in the system in my file? Why am I being given another 2 higher quotes? If I'm a ""valued customer"" why am I not given the correct and lower quote right away? And furthermore, how am I supposed to trust what they are telling me is correct on what needs to be done?

St-Viateur Bagel - for Montreal bagel tasting
Rialto Theatre - to tour the former movie palace
Drogheria Fine - for Gnocchi
Boucherie Lawrence - for meat-tasting
Kem Comba - for ice cream

They have a rather small restaurant, and during the lunch hours it can get fairly packed.  The restaurant is tactfully decorated to match it's ethnic background.  

The menu here is fairly simple with some basic but creative dishes.  My favorite by far has been the spicy basil fried rice with chicken.  It is spot on with some vegetables and rice as well as having a good amount of kick to it.  If you aren't a huge fan of heat, you can choose to have a lower heat level for any dish.  Last time I was here, my wife ordered pineapple rice with chicken.  She thoroughly enjoyed it which had some sizable chunks of pineapple and other vegetables.  The only complaint I would have is I've noticed a less than ideal amounts of chicken in the dishes.  Other than that, the portion typically is more than a single meal.

This is a cool place to have some good Thai food.  If you are nervous about trying Thai, but enjoy rice dishes, this will be a great place to start! I've also had their pad Thai here and it was extremely excellent.  Not a bad price for a downtown meal and their service, food, and staff has been very consistent.",0,p2zG6moVk1JWwxkALfWHVw

Since my friend worked for the company and I knew the GM this review will be a little biased. We had the lobster tacos, calamari, rock shrimp and some tuna for appetizers. I had a excellent sirloin that came with two types of sauces on the side a au poive pepper sauce and a red wine sauce that were both delicious. others in the party ordered the Salmon and Sea Bass that looked great. For side dishes we had the creamy spinach, lobster mashed potatoes  and sauteed mushrooms they seemed a little salty by themselves but with the steak it evened out nicely. For dessert we had the fried donuts that came with a banana and chocolate sauce. Not the cheapest meal to be had but certainly one of the best.

While the restaurant does look pretty nice (high windowed ceilings, lots of natural light, etc.), the food and service are both just kind of mediocre.

Appetizer: Goat Cheese Flat Bread (sundried tomato pesto, arugula, fresh basil, fire roasted red peppers). I ordered this because I love goat cheese and arugula, and it tasted just fine. The flat bread was a bit harder than I expected though, like I kind of forgot it was flat bread and felt like I was eating a cracker at times.

Main: Beef Bourguignon. This sounds really fancy, but really it's just like beef stew. I don't know if in reality it is actually supposed to be fancy, but the one at Trios was kind of a let down. I mean, you would expect there to be some variation in flavour, but ultimately the stew just tasted... salty. Like super salty. Apparently there were pearl onions, crimini mushrooms and double smoked bacon in the stew, but really, I have no recollection of any of that stuff. Really it was all just beef, salt, and mashed potatoes in my memories.

Dessert: Triple Cream Brie with fig preserve, spiced pecans and crostini. I actually really enjoyed this. The brie was not too strong in flavour and really was very creamy. It was delicious on its own as well as with the sweet fig preserve. This was definitely my favourite part of the meal.

Service: It seemed like the servers were trying... and they were all really nice, but I was confused. Considering the restaurant really was NOT busy, they were surprisingly absent for a lot of the time. Besides coming out to take our orders and bring us our food, for the most part they were nowhere to be seen. I remember this especially being a problem after we had all had our beef stews, and one of my friends specifically had to request to have our waters refilled because they were all low and we were all dying of thirst. Sooo can't say I was terribly impressed with this either.

Overall: Definitely a little disappointed - maybe a little bit less so if the lunch had been in the cheapest category ($18) but I don't think it was worth the $23 price tag we paid.",0,QlRsVCCytArycuuKSyUBLg

I liked my meal.  I had the gumbo soup, a great baked potato with lots of fixings, a sort of chocolate cheesecake dessert that was great.  My husband didn't like his meal.  My husband ordered a $50 steak that was fatty and gristley.  I could tell he was bummed when he poked around at his steak with furrowed eyebrows, cutting off piece after piece of inedible meat.

  I was really hoping to please him since it was his birthday.  I let them know when I made the reservations well in advance that it was his birthday and we didn't get a birthday dessert or anything free like you do at most other restaurants.  They remembered it was his birthday, the hostess (who was pleasant and very friendly) gave him a cheery happy birthday as we were going to be seated.  I really expect a little something special if we are spending our special day at their establishment.

  The waitstaff was prompt and friendly.  They seemed to linger around and dive right in when you need a refill on your drink, or in my case another great martini.  I almost forgot to mention that I loved their martinis.  

Will we return?  Definitely no.  There are way more better restaurants in Vegas.

A 2 pas de la place des Arts, c'est donc l'emplacement idéal pour qui veut profiter des festivals. Revers évident, vous en profiterez de toutes façons ! Par confort, j'ai opté pour des bouchons d'oreilles et cela a suffi à rendre mes nuits plus silencieuses ( à 4$ les 5 paires, l'investissement n'était pas ruineux).
L'accès est très facile : le bus de l'aéroport et le métro arrivent à un bloc de distance (mais pas le même :-) ). 

En arrivant à pied à l'hôtel, vous aurez peut-être remarqué quelques théâtres pour adultes. Il y a effectivement quelques mètres de trottoirs consacrées aux plus de 18 ans, et le voisinage de l'hôtel ne fait pas exception. Cependant, il n'y a rien de malsain dans cet entourage : après tout, on est au cœur de la ville.

La réception est située au premier étage, escalier obligatoire. Nous avons été très bien accueillis avec un enregistrement rapide assorti de nombreux conseils et de la documentation indispensable pour commencer notre séjour.
Nous avions opté pour une chambre économique avec salle de douche commune. La surface modeste de la chambre était compensée par un haut plafond et un grand placard, nous n'étions donc pas encombrés par nos bagages. 

Il y avait 3 salles de douche pour l'étage. Elles étaient nettoyées plusieurs fois dans la journée et je ne me suis jamais retrouvée à attendre. Ce n'est qu'à de rares occasions que j'ai trouvé des traces indiquant le passage d'autres hôtes, alors même que l'hôtel était plein.
Le wifi ne passe pas très bien dans les étages. Comme la chambre était juste au-dessus de la réception, nous avons pu en profiter. Autrement, les fauteuils de la réception vous accueilleront pour votre surf.
Pour le petit déjeuner, je crois que l'hôtel a un accord avec un restaurant tout proche. De notre côté, nous avons préféré profiter des nombreux cafés de Montréal.

The frys were very tasty and not the typical frys you get at a fast food restaurant .  The only reason I gave 4 stars is there was way too much salt on the frys.  MAKE SURE TO TELL THEM LIGHT SALT and you will give them 5 stars for sure.

Thème: Marocain 

Le premier service, le gâteau de foie gras. Beau moyen d'impressionner la galerie. Les deux fois, ont été une expérience incroyable. Le mélange de saveurs sucrées, acides et salées, c'est la décadence dans toute sa splendeur. Ensuite sont servis en même temps la tajine de boulettes de saumons avec petits pois et avocats, les calmars bouillis et farcis avec du porc un peu épicé et une leur version de porchetta avec une petite salade et des oreilles de christ soufflées. Bon, mais sans plus. Ensuite vient l'omelette. À ma première visite celle-ci était servie dans un vol-au-vent vent à l'encre de sèche avec des aubergines et une béchamel blanche et une béchamel à l'encre de sèche. J'ai personnellement vraiment pas aimé. Cette fois ci, ce plat avait été remplacé par une omelette bien soufflée avec un gros tas de bon bacon caramélisé à l'érable. Grosse grosse amélioration. Tout le monde a adoré. Ensuite sont venu les tanjia. Une sucrée et une salée. La sucrée, c'était une réussite les deux fois. La salée était 100 fois meilleure cette fois-ci comme ils ont ajouté du citron. Pour accompagner la viande, avant, ils donnaient un genre de cake de carottes avec les fèves blanches à l'intérieur et personne à aimé. On voulait même pas en rapporter dans nos doggy bags. Ils ont remplacé ce plat par une genre de bouillie bien épicée de fèves blanches avec des carottes caramélisées dans le sirop d'érable. Mega upgrade, jai adoré. Tout ça servi avec une bonne miche de pain maison.

Les desserts, quantité industrielle de desserts, soit la tire délicieuses dans un banc de granité à la menthe. Pour moi, c'est ce dessert qui l'emporte. Aussi, des crêpes aux mandarines flambées au Cointreau, une crème glacée sur un genre de gâteau au dates (je crois), de l'écorce avec crème et chocolat blanc et deux différentes pâtes d'amandes, une frite et l'autre au sucre à la crème.

It's not that I thought less of pawn shops, but I admit I had a preconceived notion of what a pawn shop experience might be. And let me tell you, I walked into a SuperPawn Cash America last night JUST to get a quote on a loan, and my preconceived notions were definitely confirmed-- I was low-balled-- they offered 10% of what I got from Max Pawn. Take my words with a grain of salt, but you definitely have a bunch of different apples around town and Max Pawn is the good one in the barrel. 

I've been to this location twice now, once to sell electronic accessories I didn't need and just wanted cash for (and was too lazy to try eBay for), and once, now, to get a loan to help me through a difficult time. I am the worst possible person when it comes to remembering names, but two really kind and professional gentlemen helped me out when it came to checking my gear out, then processing the loan. 

Times are tough, and Max Pawn offered me two friendly experiences with non-judgmental people. For pawn shop newbies, the interest rate for a month is still applicable if you pay them back in a day. I plan to be repaying the loan in two weeks, and am confident my items will be well-stored and safe until I return. 

Though kind of cheesy, I really want to thank the people here for allowing me to maintain some financial independence as I sort things out. Thank you so much! I will be sending you all as much business as I can. Your staff is awesome and your establishment is cleaner than a department store.

The other thing about Joe is he really works you over. I prefer gentle and more relaxing. After Joe, I felt like I needed a massage to recover from his massage!  I think Joe is in demand and has a loyal clientele, it was just a little too intense for me. I've had Debbie a couple of times and I now request her. Minimal conversation, gentle, relaxing.

The host was very accommodating with people from our group arriving late and ordering at different times. Can't remember his name but he was so helpful and patient the entire time.
The menu selection is pretty big! There's lots of Greek choices like pita, falafel, and souvlaki, as well as a variety of more Americanized options like pizza, pasta, calzones, sandwiches, and burgers. I had the Big Fat Greek Burger and it was a huuuuge portion. Like multiple toppings such as tomatoes and feta, with a burger patty AND plenty of gyro meat, plus it came with fries! Sooo much food.
The portions of other food looked pretty big too; other members of my group got lamb chops, Florentine pizza, calzone (which is also really big!), pasta, Greek nachos, and they all really enjoyed the food!
Plus it was happy hour so they had specials like $3 drinks, $4-5 appetizers, $19 pitchers of sangria, and I think they had half off bottles of wine that day.

The first was during restaurant week- the highlight of my meal was a dessert that was a gooey chocolatey cake with a chocolate stout shooter...but its not on their regular menu and that makes me sad. 

The second I went for the Mac N Cheese - which was meh to say the least. I ended up exchanging it because I didn't care for it, dry, over-herbed which was strange because it almost was bland. 

Today I went with some coworkers and had the lunch special. For about $8.50 you get the chicken burger with bacon, lettuce, tomato, pickle herbed aioli- more mayo textured, pimento cheese served on a delicious bun. This is served with fries, ""dessert"", and soda/Iced Tea. Great deal! 

 The  burger itself was pretty good although I'm not sure I would be back based on that alone. The fries were really good (fresh cut and herby) but when I asked for a side of ranch (don't judge) it was watery blue cheese- ick, and since I'm not a ketchup girl I wished there was a thinner aioli or something just for those...then they would be perfection! 

The dessert was a mean joke- basically they were like a Little Debbie-esque snack pecan pie with wrapping left on. I was really disappointed and wish they just made a fresh cookie or just left it out all together. 

This would have earned 3 stars but our service was terrible.

 Aloof describes our waiter perfectly well. Drinks were left unfilled, he couldn't bother to crack a smile, and he put our checks in the middle of the table (hey we all got the same thing you could have just passed it around to us politely). We had one to-go order which was the special and a salad - this took longer than all of the other meals, even though that was ordered at the same time- she was leaving early so that was definitely a problem...he also failed to mention that he added 20% gratuity- which at $1.70 a piece wasn't a big deal but it's always a bit sketch when they don't say it outright. It seemed like he knew he was getting gratuity added so he didn't bother to be friendly....so -1 star based on service alone.",2,HzEtbh5KYzfeW_MTVnGCEA

We started with the antipasto.  The portions were small especially since there was 5 of us.  Better for two people. The glaring issue was the lack of bread or something to eat with the food. 

Next I had the pizza and the daughter had the chicken parmigiana.  The pizza was tasty but the crust didn't taste like it preprocessed.  Think McCain pizza.  The toppings and cheese was tasty 

The chicken parm was Hoo hum.  What drove my daughter batty was the service.  Quick to follow up about the food - hot and tasty but refills or drinks or water felt like she was no where near by.  We had to ask for a pitcher to serve ourselves.  When my daughter and others were offered ground pepper or grated parmigian cheese the server would reach across my daughter.  Even when she cleared the appetisers plates.  Once was ok but 3-4 times became annoying. 

Was disappointed.  Too bad as the desserts looked worth giving it a try but we decided to leave instead.",0,AvecQucBNHJ-HqmpPPzfpg

I used them over 7 months on a 3 wk rotation. So this review is not based on 1 or 2 services. This is an observation over time. 
Sometimes they didn't show up on time (no big deal), no call no showed me twice and rarely sent 2 people (a very big deal). One housekeeper doing the work of 2, while you are paying for two is no good. In my opinion, the housekeeper is being overworked as Im sure the housekeeper is getting the same pay whether they have another set of hands or not. I did NOT like that. The work should be divided properly between 2 people. Like other companies. 
 
I hired another company (see my review) who ALWAYS send 2, they are cheaper, they clean the windows and blinds without charging ""extra"" and  have never ""no call no showed"" me. Both ladies are in and out in 1.5 hours TOPS with more completed.
Everytime Superb Maids no called no showed or couldn't send 2 people, I always got a bunch of excuses (Mostly using my square footage as an excuse to not consistently send 2) 
As a client it's no fun waiting 3- 4 hours at home on your day off to:
A) Have one maid show up to do the work of two which takes twice as long. (Basic things would get missed, like cleaning the floor around the toilet, top of the range and fridge, bathroom mirrors, etc.) I don't want to pay for a service, lose 4 hours of my day, so I can go over and clean missed things after she left. 
B) Wait at home for NO ONE to show up. (Also very frustrating).
The impression I got is, if you have a small house/condo, they arent really interested in your business and will skip you on your scheduled rotation for a bigger, more expensive, client.

At that point I handed back the books I did grab and left.

I haven't been to the AMC Centrium since AMC folded their Canadian operations.  As such there were only us and three other groups in the restaurant for lunch on a Saturday.

We were seated promptly, and our waitress explained the daily specials to us.  I chose to have the guiness beef stew.  I almost always order beef stew at most Irish restaurants, but my Irish friends never serve beef stew at home.  I wonder why?

This stew actually had a little bit of a spicy pepper kick to it.  Nothing to set your taste buds on fire, but enough to make you take notice.

Coconut crepe was my favorite, I ate it so fast I didn't even stop to snap a photo! Crispy on the the outside, tender and moist on the inside, stuffed with crunchy bean sprouts, shrimp and ground pork, good balance of savory with sweetness of the coconut flavor, the texture reminds of a Chinese breakfast dish called """". The lemon grass crab cake was lightly seasoned, just a hint of lemon grass, and comes with an amazing chili aioli sauce, I think I will take all my crab cakes with chili from now on.

My girl and I took some time to explore, and finally made our way to the trailer to order some food.
Staff was very friendly. We had a tuna melt and a Chicago dog. Though the tuna was good, it was not what I expected in that it was in a hoagie roll and so was not a melt in the traditional sense. The bread was dry and crunchy. It'd have been nice to have this information beforehand. So, good but disappointing. The dog was good. We also had corn which was good.

Additionally we grabbed Bloody Mary's at a bar stand. Very full of stuff but the mix was especially bitter, or vinegary. I am not a fan. Another quirky disappointment that might best to be explained to newbies, which I proclaimed.

Also, valet parking for an empty parking lot? No thanks.

Fast forward to last week, my wife and I decided to put a clear tint on my master bedroom French door windows that leads to our balcony. We wanted to do the Llumar Air 80 which we have on our front auto windshield. It is almost completely clear which should not affect our HOA as it is not reflective or dark in any way. Our main reason for wanting to do this  is for heat and UV rejection as those windows are facing west and a massive amount of heat comes into the room and whole house every afternoon til the evening hours. I remembered Brian did a standout job on our auto so I gave him a call. Surprisingly, he still remembered us and got us a quote very quickly with just the glass measurements. Made an appointment to get the job done and he was at my house bright and early the following Monday when I was available. 

You can tell Brian loves what he does by watching the way he works. He started by trimming off all the excess glue around the window panes (glue has been there since day one when the house was built and the builders just left it like that). After that he covers the floors with plastic and sprayed soap and water on the glass and cleaned it all immaculately and carefully. If the tint was to come out perfectly he had to prep it well which he did spend a good amount of time doing. Finally the tint was put on, trimmed and bubbles squeegeed out. All in all it took a good couple of hours to do just two large windows but the results are fantastic! Room temperature was cooler almost immediately and we can really feel the difference! I'm sure this will help with our air conditioning and cooling costs but most importantly is our comfort level and with the curtains back and the blinds up, it just looks so great! 

Thanks Brian for another wonderful job! I will definitely come back to you in the future for all our tinting needs!",1,rVp_G2QBx681UMpC2lKgeg

I was all prepared to get a salad but then, then I saw the magical tortilla spinner. I couldn't resist. 

I created the business listing while I was in line, waiting for it to be my turn. Was I in line for a ride at Disneyland or to get tacos? Its decor sort of reminded me of Frontierland at D-land, but the food was definitely better quality and price than that place. 

The service was quick and to the point. The food was especially delicious, considering I fancy myself a connoisseur of quick service Mexican food. I don't think they do their meats/dairy as responsibly as Chipotle, but I could be wrong. I had never been to a Cafe Rio until yesterday, so it's all new and shiny to me.

I did like how they put ""Tips to Not Get Fat Off Our Food"" in the bottom corner of the menu. (My words, not theirs, but that's definitely what they're meaning to say.) In case you don't know, you can save food for later and not eat it in one setting. OMG GUYS, did you know that??? Did you know that you don't have to eat all the food at once? Cafe Rio definitely makes it easier, as they put lids out to make everything a to-go box if you want.

I came by here for Saturday brunch after a run with my honey. First, we felt out of place because this place is fancier than the name suggests: hostesses in very nice dresses, dj, bartender, etc. Then, we were shocked by the prices. Maybe there should be another way to rate prices for breakfast places, but paying $12-$15 a plate for breakfast is more than we expected for eggs benedict or a hash dish. Although the food was fairly good, it just wasn't as mind-blowingly good as I had heard it would be or as I would hope it would be for the price. Overall, I have to say that the service was great. The servers and hostesses were attentive and helpful. Everyone around me seemed to be enjoying their meals. This place just wasn't for me.",1,Hyli6YWc-0PxRAerObzZIQ

A. Deer Valley- Great, probably my favorite Costco in/near Phoenix, but a little bit far from Surprise.
B. Arrowhead- Closest one to us, but ALWAYS a clusterfuck!
C. Avondale- Close, but had never been, so it would be the first time at this one.

We went with Avondale and I was glad we did!

We got there pretty early after opening which was nice.  We got a parking spot right next to the entrance, and had free roam throughout the store before the crowds started to pile up.  If you have been to any Costco, you know the type of stuff they carry.  We picked up our usual supplies, and were in and out within about 30 minutes.  Greeter at the door was incredibly friendly, as well as the boxer/cashier.  I can't remember a time where I had a less stress free experience at Costco.  It could have been due to how early it was, but whatever, it was a great trip!  I think I will be using this one in the future when the family has to make a run. (Will still use the Deer Valley one if I need an item or two..its 2 minutes from work).

1. When I gave him a dollar for a hard way bet, he kept it. It never went on the double 5's I asked for. Maybe he's sexist and didn't believe I knew how to play the game? (You know, cuz I'm a woman. So obvi I don't know how to play craps.)

I found out later that they closed at 9 but it's a good thing that we eat quick. The food made it easy for us to do it though. Our waiter spoke Cantonese so it was great because my mom and grandmother barely speak English. It was a fusion restaurant so a bit of the familiar mixed with unfamiliar made for a great experience.

It's quite a small restaurant with not a lot of seating. Some may feel it's cramped but it wasn't a big deal.

We pretty much ordered half the menu. I order all 3 steamed mantou sandwiches, pork jowl skewers, confit duck wings, tea smoked duck breast, torched mackerel, fried chicken and lamb ribs.

Out of the 3 sandwiches, I'd have to say that the brisket and pork belly were on par with one another and the chicken one was just alright. The former two were very flavorful. Each basket comes with two sandwiches.

I think I enjoyed the pork jowl skewers the most. Just the right amount of fat for the tenderness plus it was both sweet and spicy on top of that.

I thought the duck wings were okay. I'm used to trying the duck wings from the local grocery store and they didn't taste that much different. Not sure if I'd order it again or if I got good value.

When it came to the duck breast, it didn't seem that different from the smoked duck breast that you get from the store. It just might seem like a thing regarding duck at this point. This was the most expensive thing on the menu so I expected a bit more.

The torched mackerel was worth it. It was tangy as most mackerel are and we spent a lot of time eating it. They said it was boneless but I found a bone here and there so be careful.

I don't really remember how the lamb ribs were so... I'm just going to say forgettable. Might have to order it again to see if they actually were.

The fried chicken here was awesome. They gave us a lot and it was extremely crunchy. It was good by itself but even better with the hot sauce. The kimchi was a bit random but I like kimchi.

My brother and grandma enjoyed it but my mom loved it. She was so busy eating, she didn't even have time to talk. I think the bill came up to $150 for the 4 of us. So, it was a bit on the pricey side but I'd still come back after saving a little or maybe I just won't order too many expensive items.",2,SNsGwqisRVFQ4N8EQID1Ag

UEvT2XH9RVFaZQqmw_f4xQ,0,2015-01-03 21:35:39,2,1dPNo1Fgs7OsFpuhGVKqHA,1,"Worst experience EVER.  My mom and myself brought my sister in because she was still feeling awful from what her primary had diagnosed as strep throat.  The antibiotics weren't helping and we thought it may be walking pneumonia.  As soon as we got in, the concierge who seemed to lack any type of enthusiasm at all got her in the system and my sister and I were directed to the next counter to get a bracelet.  Only about 10 minutes go by before she is taken back and poked and prodded.  The doctor didn't say hello to my mom or myself at all, although the nurses were friendly.  We tried to explain that she may have pneumonia but he quickly dismissed us.  My sister can be rather flustered in this type of situation so we tried to help explain, but since she is 18, they wanted nothing to do with what we had to say.  They did not to an X-ray which startled the nurse who came back with her results later, but more on that down the line.  

After her insurance was recorded into the system, we were hurried back out into the waiting room where a few more people had populated.  My family and I were making conversation when we noticed a couple other patients complaining about the wait, which they had been told would be a few minutes, that turned into an hour or more.  One woman white, one black *It's important to know this, trust me*.  The black woman, who we learned was named Jasmine, found she was being charged for a room that she was never in.  She asked the nurse politely to speak to someone, as well as what was taking so long.  This prompted the white woman to also ask about what had taken so long seeing as her son was ill enough and like anyone in an ER setting, they wanted to get the hell out of there.  The nurse was very rude to both of them and was getting smart, so the black woman (Jasmine) asked for her name and the nurse covered her badge, but Jasmine thinking quickly, already saw it, and immediately asked for a social worker.  The social worker came out and spoke with the white woman but not to Jasmine, completely ignoring her, and worst of all, as soon as Jasmine spoke up for her right to speak to someone, with zero attitude, they called security to stand nearby just in case.

While Jasmine waited, the security guard whom I had a bad feeling about, was talking major smack about Jasmine to another patient.  Completely unprofessional right off the bat.  The nurse who refused to give her name was offering blankets to people in the waiting room, all except Jasmine.  PURE RACISM!!!!!

Eventually, my sister was taken back and given her results which were mild to say the least.  The doctor had recommended that she stop her antibiotics, which is stupid.  I come from a medical background and never once has anyone thought it was a good idea to stop your AB's before they are finished.  As we turned to leave we saw Jasmine crying in a corner with what I assumed was another doctor.  Jasmine ran up to my mom and said that the staff had called the cops on her and planned to have her trespassed.  My mom stayed behind because Jasmine was scared.  My sister and I went to get food and of course, by now I'm infuriated.  Under my breath, and directed toward my sister, I said ""piece of shit security guards"", which caught the ear of one of them.  He shouted at me as I rounded the corner out of the door.  As I exited, he came up to me, now mind you we are outside of his jurisdiction at this point as I was obviously leaving and not looking for a fight.  He came 2 inches from my face, cursing at me and telling me that he will have me trespassed.  I continued to say ""yes sir"" just to get him out of my face.  He went on about how there were sick people in this building, one of them being my sister who he was scaring the shit out of at the moment.  I walked away and returned with food for my family.  My sister was so anxiety ridden she couldn't function until she got to see my mom.  She had the idea in her head that the security guard would hurt her after his little display with me.  As soon as I told my mom what had happened, she lost her shit and asked for his name.  Needless to say, they claimed not to know his name and refused to give it up but said that my mom could pick up the red security phone and ask the security department for his name.  When she did so, the phone was silent on the other end and they refused to give his name up also. 

 We left and will not be back.  A police report was filed by me and my sister due to the incident with the security guard.",2,bZgCNqybOazCT51JClzzrw

And I will reiterate, just start calling this location, ""Walmart""...because it is very clear that the employees and management team cannot hold up to what Target's standards are supposed to be. 

I avoid this Target at all costs if need be, you can smell the bathrooms that are located in the front of the store all the way in the back of the store. It's dirty, it's unorganized. I've said enough.

I'm re-writing this review because of the experience I had yesterday evening with an associate, Carlo. 

Yesterday evening I brought my son (who is 18 months old) in for a quick errand. We stopped by the bargain section and I let him pick out a sippy cup.

At checkout, I was speaking to the cashier (Carlo) about a price check - which he already had an attitude with me. 

Before I continue let me just point out that I am pretty well mannered, I have my child under control and I'm a normal person, not doing anything to deserve this attitude. 

While speaking with Carlo, my son, WHO IS 18 MONTHS. Is trying to hand him the sippy cup to scan it, he's not screaming or crying or tempering, just reaching the cup towards him that doesn't even reach up half way to his chest. 

Mid-conversation, Carlo grabs my son's wrist and yanks the sippy cup out of his hand like he was holding a firework and did something wrong.

Admittedly, I have never had something like this happen with my son. Ever. So I didn't even react, I was just in shock. He didn't say anything, scoffed at me, didn't thank me at the end, say have a nice night, nothing.

I left the store embarrassed and in shock thinking I did something wrong as a parent. I considered calling management but thought I was overreacting. Took some time to really think of it and thought, in no way was it moral of this employee to put his hand on my son like that. Even if he was being a brat (which let me remind you, he wasn't). That's not your kid, that's not your job. YOU DON'T PUT YOUR HAND ON A CUSTOMER'S CHILD FORCEFULLY. 


I contacted the store after thinking and was unable to get a hold of a manager. Shocker. 

That was it for me, never coming to this Walmart again. And I hope I never see Carlo out of his place of employment.

After 10 minutes of staring like a deer in headlights I had to ask for a menu. Someone was kind enough to pour us water, but we had to get up and find some straws, coasters, and silverware. The bartender was working like the entire US Congress was eating at Burntwood. The restaurant wasn't even busy....there were 7 customers at the bar. We watched as he poured his drinks and what a waste of booze. I don't think bartenders make drinks that fast on New Years....slow down cowboy. It was so comforting to watch him never wash his hands. He also placed the clean rack of dished right in front of us. Very rude and inconsiderate ""bar tender"". 

Our food came quick and it was good. No one ever came to ask us how the food was which was disappointing because I needed more ketchup. The bar had 4 people working and not one of them showed any interest in receiving a good tip. The restaurant manager was behind the bar at one point and didn't bother to ask how our meal was. I didn't even know who our server was because there were so many servers behind the bar. Cheers to the happy hours specials, but I'll never go back.

When it comes to seafood, I am quite picky of the geographical location of where the consumption of seafood takes place. Especially, if I am not surrounded by some sort of body of water. I grew up by the beach. So naturally my mentality is, if it ain't fresh, I ain't eatin' it!

Pittsburgh is not near an ocean but it does have rivers (lots of them!). Anyhow, I didn't ask them where they got their fish from. However, by the look, smell, and taste of the sushi, I cant tell it is fresh. The quality of fish is SUPERB! 

Also I overheard the sushi chef tell the story of his life. He's from Japan, lived in New York and had a sushi restaurant, moved to Pittsburgh, owned a Japanese grocery store in Shadyside, then opened up Kiku. While watching him make sushi, I noticed him using gloves AND washing his hands!!! I mean I've never seen that before but my inner-nurse was jumping for joy! 

I love that this place is authentic and quaint! There's none of that ""goop"" slathered on rolls, there's nothing wrong with that. But if you are looking for something more traditional. Kiku is definitely a hidden treasure.

What I loved: 
1. Miso soup - one word can describe it. UMAMI!!
2. Kagoshima - because I love yellowtail
3. Temaki Spicy tuna 
4. Nigiri Toro
5. TOMAGO!!! - slightly sweet and well made. One of the Best!

This was due to two reasons: the poor cuts of beef and the bad managerial decision.

Steak:
We ordered one of each steak cut: the tenderloin, sirloin, and the rib eye. The 8oz tenderloin was well executed and the highlight of the night. The cut was tender and juicy. However, it went downhill from there. The sirloin and the rib eye were far too tough and chewy. There were literal pieces of tendon dispersed throughout the cut, which made chewing very difficult. It wasn't particularly flavourful either. The steaks were impressive merely due to the lava stones upon which they were served; they were otherwise a disappointment. 
My dad also ordered the lamb shank, a pitiful piece of mush that came drowning in an overly sickening sweet BBQ sauce. There was absolutely no flavour whatsoever; it was an overdone, overbraised lamb. That said, I suppose we were at fault for ordering something other than steak at a steakhouse.

Service:
We came to celebrate my sister's birthday; I had called in advance to let then know and asked whether there would be any dessert or celebration. The manager had mentioned that they could bring a cake with a birthday song and decorate it nicely - just to let him know upon arrival. I did just that, but decided to confirm whether the celebration would be on the house. He said that it wouldn't be, which is totally fine, so I told him that I'd reconsider and let him know later. Halfway during the meal, he walks by with a pat on my shoulder, assuring me that he ""will take care of it"". From that, I assumed that he decided to provide the cake on the house, and was delighted. You can imagine my shock when I see the $8 charge on the bill at the end! While the celebration was a nice gesture, I never explicitly asked for it. That was because I didn't feel that a measly small piece of cake was worth $8, no matter how good. For him to make a decision on my behalf - the customer's behalf - is simply unacceptable.
The servers, though friendly, had difficulties understanding our order. The sides for the steak were switched, so we had to go through the trouble of righting their mistakes. Moreover, they just kept checking in on us, which almost felt as if they were breathing down our necks a bit. It was slightly pushy and overwhelming. 
Finally, the table space was very tight. There was simply insufficient room for all the plates and stones. However, despite our raising of this point, they simply dismissed it. The cramped table simple made dining there uncomfortable.

Conclusion:
If you're craving a good steak, I would not choose this place. If you're interested in the experience of the lava stone, then sure, come and try. I won't come again only because I feel that we were ripped off with the sudden charge and delivery of the birthday cake.",3,0Zswwlz4NzUJoG-skyWzIw

ajoqEHnCZTD8-8GqGLq9-Q,0,2013-10-10 22:22:35,0,ebtOQUVX4kkzAKjY1_k_bA,2,"I recently stayed here, not even a week ago, and it was less than okay, and I'll explain why...

1) This hotel is not located on the strip, initially I knew that, but my boyfriend was dying to stay here so I compromised, knowing that there'd be a shuttle plus he said we'd just take cabs seeing as though it was only a mile from the strip. Come to find out the shuttle ran every half hour which is horrible, & only sat 12 ppl so if you were the 13th you would have to wait until the next one came which was a whole half an hour later AND it stopped running at 8 so if you wanted to leave your hotel after 8 or come back from the strip to your hotel after 8 that's a 12 dollar cab with cash, 15 with a card (for a mile long ride!). You can see how hanging out after 8 outside of your hotel can add up in cab fees if there's only 2 of you like it was for me.

2) When checking in there were only two receptionists and they moved pretty damn slow. We checked in, I want to say around 11pm, which is probably why there were only two staff but it's a hotel, it's Vegas, people are checking in all the time, so the wait for that was a little ridiculous.

3) The wifi was Blahhh, it was very slow and I had to enter my name and room number constantly to keep connecting back to it... Annoying!

4) The food wasn't cheap at all, it was 45 bucks for my boyfriend and I to eat at the buffet which I thought would have been fitting for two ppl that didn't stay in the hotel opposed to two ppl that did BUT I will say that they served endless champagne which diffused the situation for me, they did good with that (finally!)

5) There was a $20 fee a night so when I was checking out that was $80 for me but they attempted to charge us for a Gatorade and some other item that we never used which hiked up the price. After we told them we hadn't used anything in the mini bar they did take those items off of the bill. Twenty dollars a night is still kind of ridiculous after paying hundreds of dollars for the hotel room already, don't you think?

6) At this point I'm done talking about this place! There are already too many deterring points I've made about this hotel that I just do not feel like continuing. On the ups the room was nice and newly renovated and we had two beds when we only needed one, the bathroom was really nice and the tv had cable so good job on that I guess. We were able to do one party at the ""Moon something"" for free after putting ourselves on the guest list. The party itself was a little corny but the rooftop view was pretty cool.

7) All in all if you MUST stay here it won't be your worst experience, especially if you're richer than me, lol, but I would recommend staying somewhere on the strip, it's much more convenient, some of the hotels are less expensive, and you won't have to worry about carfare after 8pm! I, however, would NEVER stay here again!",0,WSnWdc_uKEN0yuNsDqD1PQ

Despite the small walk-through space and single bathroom, you can't go wrong with the tinted lighting, wood and brick walls, and open kitchen concept, making for a very welcoming dining atmosphere.

The food is slightly on the pricey side, with an average dish ranging from $25-37 depending on what you order. But the portions are well worth every dollar. One dish is enough to satisfy a big eater; two dishes will induce food coma. And when you're dealing with meats slow cooked to perfection, marinated with simple yet delicious flavours, and well complimenting sides, it can get very easy to get carried away with wanting to try everything.

I sat down with five other friends, all of us guys and in Montreal for a bachelor party (attention bachelor party planners, this is the perfect place for dinner). They sat us near the open window, which for a warm evening was great. It gave us room to breathe and a good view of the restaurant or of the street depending on where we looked.

After a round of beers, we shared a Boudin Tart and a Duck Carpaccio. The tart crust was light and crispy topped with caramel onion, potato, and blood sausage cooked to perfection. The foie gras drizzle on top made for a light but wonderfully complex marriage of flavours and the dish was shared evenly among us. The Duck Carpaccio went as quickly as it appeared. The thinly sliced pieces of raw duck signified meat of the highest quality and flavour, and it was balanced out with an egg yolk, olive oil, mushrooms, capers, and mushrooms.

The main dishes were equally spectacular. The PDC cut was a roast so big, it had to share it. It was cooked very well. A crispy flavourful exterior with a well done first layer down to a juicy medium rare interior. The veal rib was a massive, single rib with melt off the bone, tender, and astoundingly seasoned meat. My duck magret in mushroom sauce was absolutely spectacular. The sauce was a light white wine flavouring, thinly sliced mushrooms covering thin slices of duck cooked medium rare. With each slice, the flavour of the duck became more noticeable.

Dessert was light, since by this point we were all stuffed. I ordered a maple toffee milkshake. It wasn't big; served in the same glass as our beer. It was a frothy shake, not thick, but it also had a light, non-invasive sweetness. The toffee flavour came from a thick piece of toffee that sat in the shake and could be eaten at any time. It was a satisfying end to a satisfying meal.

The star lost was mainly due to the poor service we got from the main waitress. The bus boy was fantastic. He promptly refilled our water and got us more bread than we could stomach. The runner was equally pleasant. But the main waitress had a bit of attitude from her greeting, was not helpful in any way, and never came back to check on us. If it weren't for her assisted helpers, we would have had no interaction with any staff. Also, we were warned that the PDC cut would take 50 minutes to prepare, but after an hour of waiting, no one came with an update. I can see how this would have turned off tourists from recommending the place, or from wrecking the dining experience.

However, Au Pied de Cochon has quickly become a go to place whenever I'm in Montreal. The food is fantastic, the atmosphere is great, and when you talk about value, I wouldn't have been angry if the prices were even higher than they are considering the quality. I highly recommend this place!",0,Usp0AbFpIkwe2ya3DAbZmQ

I told her that our daughter had a peanut allergy and if I could see the food allergy menu.  She had no idea what I was talking about.  When we asked if there were any items that have peanuts in them or were cooked with peanut sauce or peanut oil, she said the hummus.  While it sounded strange, we didn't say anything at the moment.  Later when she brought our food, I asked if the hummus was really made with peanuts or maybe she meant chickpeas?   She said she had to ask the kitchen and get back to us.  Overall, our food was okay, but nothing great.

Upon arriving at the Vdara, the experience was remarkable. As soon as you walk into the lobby, you automatically get this great feel of classiness and cleanliness all over. A very slick and sexy hotel no doubt, great for everyone. Even though the Vdara has no casino, its actually a great benefit. Nice and quiet, great for relaxing and if you're ready to gamble, the Cosmopolitan and the Aria are literally feet away. Another benefit of the Vdara is that you have the tram station at your hotel which leads you to the Aria and Monte Carlo, very very convenient and nice ride too, you get a great view of the City Center that you cant get without getting on the tram. The rooms are amazing, very modern and classy as well. I also had a great view of the Bellagio fountains and the Cosmo, nothing better than waking up watching the show.

For those of you unfamiliar with the word, truie means sow in French so the name refers to a fat female pig.  The menu is true to its name so there are plenty of pork-inspired dishes here.

The restaurant looks very simple and unassuming from the outside.  Once inside though it feels elegant and intimate.  It is also quite large inside so there is plenty of seating to be had.  They also have a terrasse that looks like it would be a nice place to sit in warmer months.

While there are some non-pork based dishes like beef tartare and duck I thought it best to see if the restaurant does a good job with pork products.  That meant that I ordered the tomahawk, which was a pork chop garnished with apple sauce and served with a sweet potato puree.  I enjoyed the flavours of the dish but I felt that the meat was a little overdone as it was on the tough and chewy side.  The portion was pretty big so I'm glad I skipped the appetizer since that would have been overkill.  I also tried a mouthful of my friend's ribs which were really tender.

Dessert was a brownie served with caramel bacon ice cream.  The ice cream was really good and I liked how the salty and sweet balanced each other out.  The tiny chunks of bacon also added a nice touch.  The brownie on the other hand was rock hard and impossible to eat with the spoon they gave me.  It was really dense and chocolatey so that was what seemed to give it that hard texture but I would have traded some of that for something that was softer and easier to eat.

The service was great.  Our server seemed to know the menu inside and out and he did a great job with recommendations.  Everything arrived in a timely fashion and he did check on us regularly to see how we were doing.

Prices were okay but I felt that since my dishes weren't the greatest they could have been better.  I think the restaurant definitely has potential but it does need to work on its execution a bit.

We upgraded to a room with a view of the strip, opened the window, and there was the Eiffel Tower. Pow! The pool is lovely, although a bit chilly this time of year. The street walk (inside) really does remind me of Paris, although the prices are too high. I was looking for quality croissants or French rolls, and didn't find them, sadly. 

With the upgrade we got continental breakfast and drinks and ""appetizers"" at night. We felt that was a great bargain because the night food became our dinner. And two drinks apiece per night was plenty. The breakfast was plenty, too, with yogurt, fruit and cheese, bagels and lox, and so on. Much more than ""continental"" suggests.

The worst thing about the Paris is the Frankie Valli music in the elevators--yuck! After listening to that ad nauseum, I would never see ""Jersey Boys.""

The second worst is the loud, pounding music that hit our room until 4:30 am (!), and we were on the 21st floor (!!!).

Even the fries were really good. The turkey was fresh and the dijonaisse really added a good flavor. Everything is seasoned generously but I like seasoning but I can see how someone can think it's too much. 

The madame croque was out of this world. It's brioche bread with ham and gruyere cheese, a Parmesan crust on the brioche and an over easy egg on top. So simple but so good. It comes with a small side of brown mustard I believe and a couple mini pickles. I highly recommend this dish. 

All in all great atmosphere, great service, great food. I will definitely be back when I am in Vegas again.",0,ahYit2oLd0uYyYcTn69bEg

They accepted a ton of faded and cheap fashion from places like Forever 21 and other no name brands and their assortment was awful as a result. This store is geared toward teens who dress casual and wear leggings and athletic tops. I never saw so many pairs of faded overpriced leggings and dirty boots. I was expecting high end dresses, blouses, and pants from WHBM, Arden B, Express, Ann Taylor, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, etc. But it was all junk and I feel bad for the owner because it looks like Goodwill in there.

-My husband and I pay as much as our gym membership, which is a plus! Good prices and there are often specials or upgrades that come free or at a low price.

The first few times we got breakfast and I highly recommend for eggs benedict fans to get it here. I love hollandaise and they are not skimpy with it, ham actually has flavor, perfect poach eggs. I tried the crab cake version too, and surprised I liked the original better. The corned beef hash was another we tried and I thought it was tasty. I love their potatoes the brekkies come with and the bagels of their name sake actually are quite nice. 

Then I decided to try their corned beef sandwich and was prepared to be only mildly satisfied. I have a little Jewish corner of my heart that beats for childhood Saturdays at Langer's. The corned beef was flavorful, juicy and the marbled bread I chose was great. I always eat mine with  coleslaw and Russian dressing (aka thousand island). I'm normally into pickles, but theirs is closer to cucumber than pickle so I'm not the most fond of it. The sandwich was so good, I was a bit sad to  share with the BF and take the other half of the benedict even though I love the bennie. 

So we came back several more times to get our own. I have to say that the way to go is the soup and half sandwich deal ($10.95- $11.95). It actually comes out cheaper with more food since the sandwich was just as big as a 1/4th lb, you get soup and can even get a side if you wish for $1. The matzo ball soup here is decent, and the sweet and sour stuffed cabbage was nice though I dropped my phone in it trying to Yelp it. We also tried the lobster salad sandwich and that was solid, but I'm gonna stay with the meat sandwiches..... I should mention I lean towards mostly eating vegetarian and this place is testing it. 

Service is pretty decent on checking up. We also don't go during busy times as this is the type of place that gets swamped during regular breakfast/lunch hours on weekends. Beat the busy by heading in a bit later in the afternoon. 

While the sandwich and benedict have been stellar, the dessert counter has been extreme highs and lows so much so that I can't justify a 5star. 

The best: The rugulach are awesomely good. I normally don't like chocolate ones but I love them here, the almond ones are great, all the fruit ones are great. There is not a bad one so even though it is priced per pound, I feel this is worth it. 
The subpar: I'm not fond of the black and white cookie being more like cake. I know a lot of delis do this and I'm just more of a shadortbred person.  The rainbow cookies were okay, but not quite up to my standard with it being too wet though the sponge flavor was right on (those are one of my favorite deli sweets). The homemade twinkie was a bit dry.
 The bad: we got a slice of buttercream cake which was painfully sweet with the frosting tasting like boxed. It was thick, sticky and you can feel sugar granules in it with the cake itself also rather sweet. It was a throwaway so I will not be getting anything else but rugulachs. The desserts aren't cheap for what they are...Spent $27 with only the rugulachs being the only thing we are gonna eat the entirety of. 

This is great place and I do highly recommend this as a go-to if you're in the area, just know how to navigate the deli and massive menu through recommendations.",6,n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew

I went here for a quick staycation over the weekend for my anniversary and I couldn't ask for anything more special. The beauty of the resort and the service I received from every single staff member was Incredible! 

Check in is normally at 4pm but I called that morning and the staff was very kind over the phone and found an available room so we were able to check-in at 12pm. All parking is valet so you pull up, and the bell hops will help unload your car and direct you to check in desk. The staff was so nice checking us in and then even greeted us with a fresh glass of champagne. Our bell hop walked us to our room and even explained a little history about the resort. Like it used to be a home in 1922. 

The rooms are large and beautiful. We had a huge soaker tub and a large double shower head walk in shower. We also had a free Keurig in the room and a private patio. My favorite part was the bed! It was so fluffy and felt like a cloud! Best sleep of my life! They do a turn down service at night so they come in and turn down bed sheets, give chocolates, and close the curtains so your ready for bed. We received a gift of chocolate covered strawberries and champagne for our anniversary when we got back to the room. Such a romantic evening. 

This is a very beautiful historic Spanish style resort so very little kids which is nice for a special romantic occasion. There is multiple courtyards that all look different so it's gorgeous to just walk all the pathways and explore. Beautiful lit up at night. There is benches, tables, games, waterfalls, and fruit trees all over the property. Great large pool and jacuzzi which is open 24-7 so you can go anytime at night when it's less busy. They do have a great poolside bar and it's pretty packed during the day. 

Check-out was at 12pm but they are very accommodating so just a quick call down to front office they let us know we can check out at 1pm which allowed us more time to relax in the morning. We ordered breakfast in bed of pancakes and a fried egg sandwich which were both amazing! 

Overall everything from start to finish was amazing. Such a beautiful resort to stay at for a romantic evening and the staff made our stay so special. I'm very excited to come back, if not sooner, at least for our anniversary next year. Next time I want to try the famous T Cooks restaurant on property that I herd great things from. 

Thank you Hyatt and royal palms for making our anniversary so special!",23,MQwSyZ2MZ6N7rtAmphZCow

Less than a handful of customers in the shop but 8 staffs over the counter. It was a bit intimidating at first since they were all just waiting for me to place an order. But I could imagine there being a nice assembly system once the shop gets busy in peak hours.  I got a bit indecisive after checking out their menu. They offer prefixed items (some with ice creams, some without) and customized option in which you can build your own by adding toppings for a cost. It took me a bit of time to decide which option to go for but I ended up building my own with a cappuccino waffle base with a scoop of sesame seed ice cream drizzled with chocolate Syrup and sprinkled with icing sugar. Price came to about $8. I originally wanted to try their milk tea waffle but it was unavailable at the time. I was surprised to find their cappuccino waffle to actually taste like coffee. The base was crispy and aromatic with strong coffee flavour in every bite. The sesame ice cream is decent, not really packed with intense sesame flavour but the flavour was there. I'd actually prefer the ice cream to be more flavorful but in my case since the cappuccino waffle was so strong already, the ice cream created a good balance.

Overall, I think I had a great experience and I'd come back to try other flavors when I'm in the area.",1,bZL7No5qUkfhOMEBU9Nqgg

The downside, my fiance ordered the ""calzone pizza"" you can see that this is listed for yourself under the pizza section here: http://www.cibophoenix.com/cena.pdf. Across from it you see the ""Crostone"" which is described as being a calzone. You can see where this is going. They served up a calzone. We asked a gentleman working there about it- he was clueless as to what might even be on the menu- and then made us feel crazy. Then the waitress came over and we asked her and she said that both of those menu items are calzones. Which is strange since one is described as a calzone- they other as an actual pizza. 
She said this happens ""all the time."" 
That's fine but either change your menu, or let someone know when they are ordering it that they are NOT ordering a pizza. I will also say that the pecorino cheese on the pear salad is cut so thick that in the candle light it looked like jicama. The service continues to be bad, we waited time and time again for water, they never asked if we wanted to order more wine, and the check came quickly, but it was with our credit-card on the table for about 20 mins. SERIOUSLY! Also, they seem to have some kind of ant problem in the courtyard- we were bit up before we even ordered.

As far as price goes, I got a bacon bfast burrito for around 7 dollars (add potatoes, tax included). I don't consider this a good deal. When I grade breakfast burritos I look at three things: meat to egg/potato ratio, flavor, and size. Unfortunately I don't  think this burrito grades well anywhere. There isn't enough meat, you can't taste the bacon, the middle of the burrito tasted like mush, and the burrito overall was small. I would recommend skipping the bfast burrito.

I use the word 'famous' because they are heavily embellished with awards even from the Thai Royal government and had serviced big screen celebrities like Jackie Chan, Jessica Alba and the list goes on. Head chef Sasi was an iron chef winner and is celebrity status herself.

With such an adorned list of accomplishments, we arrived ready to culinarily enlighten. Once you walk up the stairs into the restaurant, the place has an old antique feeling to it like a mashup of a Thai temple and a traditional diner. A little worn but lots of traditional flair.

Their menu had a lot going on as it was so wordy that it was a little hard to navigate through. We decided to place our full trust in our servers recommendations and ordered the most popular items:

- Tom yum soup: this was the most sour Tom yum I have ever had. The sourness was so overpowering that it was hard for me to enjoy any other flavour that accompanied it.
- Divine crispy morning glory: battered thai spinach, it was fried similar to tempura style with a nice sweet and sour glaze. I thoroughly enjoyed this and would recommend.
- Sasi's red curry chicken with lychee: served in a pineapple and had lychee in the curry, interesting concept but can't say I was a fan. The taste was a little bland and it didn't have a strong flavour profile. The chicken meat was also slightly overcooked. 
- Sasi's pad Thai: the noodles were nice and chewy and it was a solid pad thai but again there wasn't a distinctiveness that would make me want to get it again.

Overall, it was still a satisfying meal and I wouldn't go as far to say this is a tourist trap because I'm sure Sasi is a super talented and great chef. However, our actual experience with the food here dulled in comparison to the glowing expectations of celebrity chef resto.",8,C3aIEUOx-vrHAeGVDnMAjg

Bun dac biet (Combo Vermicelli) - plenty of meat, 2 egg rolls and the ngoc mum was great.

Banh Mi Dac Biet - big enough to share, tasted ok as the bread felt and tasted a little stale.

2 Special chicken pho - soup tasted clean, but the chicken was over cooked.

Com dac biet 5 Mon (5 items, grilled pork, chicken, egg roll, shrimp, and Chinese sausage) - kids loved it.

Bot chien - first time and probably our last. It's just fried eggs with crispy.noodle cake.

Me and my girlfriend usually go on a Friday to have drinks after work which is very good and relaxing for us help to get rid of all those weekday problems that you've had all week.

I usually get something simple like a whiskey and coke which for 2 for 1 is 2 for $3.50 which you can't find anywhere besides maybe Fremont Street for even one for $3.50.

One thing I will say is that the bartenders are awesome they like to talk I like to be interactive and they like to make you feel like you are family which is a great thing for a bar because then you feel like you want to come back and you want to interact with them as well.

I did notice that they have gotten a new cuz I don't know if the cook overnight is the same or if they have change that I do have one problem the last time I went late at night the bartender had to end up helping the cook get our food out quick cuz it took so long and when it did come it wasn't good and it looks like the bartender had actually gone back and cook the food himself because the cook that was back I didn't know what he was doing that was a very late night for us around 4 a.m. so I have not been back that late to see if the Cook has changed but as far as the one that's there during the happy hour he is pretty good and haven't had any problems since I do only go during the four to seven happy hour.",1,9qFJOY7CcgCWuUFMVRttNg

Don't get me wrong, I love to do jumps in a car with no brakes, makes me feel alive - but this car was not jumped nor driven in such a way that the sway bar could've flipped. It was probably upside down because the previous owner that killed the brakes had some aftermarket junk on the car that he took off before trading the car in and since Carmax apparently doesn't look at sway bars and brakes while inspecting their vehicles, it just flew under the radar.

It was a not-so-sunny-it-might-rain-not-sure-oh-here's-the-sun-oh-wait-it's-gone kinda weekday but as we arrived around 6.30 the place was nevertheless packed (inside and out). Ok, fine, it must be good then! 
As I'm freezing (no, literally) under 25degrees, we headed in and triumphatly we managed to elbow-wrestle our way to an empty table squeezed in between other tables ""Oops sorry didn't mean to leave my derriere in your food but I like didn't have a choice if I wanted to get to my seat! Looks good though!""
Beer menu is very interesting with their own brews and food menu although short is mouth-watering with good food and vegan option which as always doesn't come cheap.
We shouted our order to the waitress (see reason below) and got a blonde and a white beer, the Tempeh sandwich and the cheese board. We found nothing exciting with any of it and for the price, were still hungry.
The staff is courteous but no more. The atmosphere is really loud from the over-loud volume of the music and everyone trying to shout over it to be heard by their table companions.

After standing in line for almost an hour and a half I will say that the gumbo i had was one of the best gumbos i have ever tasted. I have friends from New Orleans and this topped theirs. The oysters i had were steamed just right. Horseradish sauce had just the right twang to it. If you have a car in Vegas definately go here.

However, the moment we ordered we were ignored and forgotten about all night even though we were sitting beside the hostess.  We ordered a lot of food and none of it was spectacular.  
The Portuguese Mac and Cheese was bland and unremarkable.  There was not a lot of seasoning and nothing special about it.  
The Shrimp Po' Boy Sandwich was waaay over seasoned.  The sauce had a weird taste and was just salt city.  Half of the shrimp was well cooked the other half was overcooked. The only good part of the sandwich was the bread.  
The slider platter was supposed to have three distinct flavours, but everyone agreed that it all tasted the same.  The burgers themselves had a funny spongy quality about them which made it off putting. 
The Goa Chicken was an entree which was twice the cost of an appetizer, but was the same size as an appetizer.  We were almost done dinner and had asked twice about the dish before it finally arrived.  The sauce was not spicy or flavorful,  and the texture of the chicken mimicked the rice.  There was nothing special about this entree and we all agreed it wasn't worth the money.  
The pierogies were super sweet for a savoury dish and the dough had a strange texture to it.   It was too much dough and not enough cheese and potato.

I have taken a ride on the light rail a few times now and I have some stories!! The first time I rode the light rail I took it from Mill Ave to Phoenix to see the D-Backs and Cubs play. My friends had caught a tram in Mesa so I sat there and watched a few trams come and go before I got onto the one with my friends on it. That was easy enough...there was enough room for me and the ride was smooth and fun (though I can't say it was relaxing)...Any ways. After the game was quite an experience! The tram ride home was a little more crowed now that the game had let out. There were two die hard fans in our car from the two teams who started talking trash to each other...well one of them had a little too much to drink and one thing lead to another and they were soon yelling threats at each other. Right before the drunker one took a swing (in a very crowded car) an older man stood up and shut them both up before someone got hurt...the tension in the air was thick the whole way back to Tempe where the Cub fan got off and punched the window. The friends of the other guy had to hold him back...I mean come on!! 

Okay, then I had the pleasure of using the light rail to go to the Circus. Again I was headed to Phoenix but this time I got on at the Washington stop. It was again a fun ride, but I couldn't say that it was a relaxing ride...there was this bum who was asking people for money and I think it would be better with some music playing in the background...any ways the ride home wasn't as eventful as the baseball game crowd, but again, there was another bum asking for money...can people just ride in peace?

I like the light rail - I really do...it's always an interesting experience, but I just don't feel safe on it. I used to take the metro bus from Gilbert to Mesa every day for a while and I felt safer on that then I do on the light rail and the bums who ride the bus don't ask me for money either.",5,116AVKourTNRaX_b_2ar_Q

We showed up to wait for a table (mind you there are about 45 tables open outside and we were okay with eating outside). The hostess said it would be a 15 minute wait anyway (why? I don't know). So we're sitting outside by the door and near a fan. We've been waiting for a while and I get up to go check to see if they called our name. Apparently the hostess did (inside? she knew we were outside) and since we weren't there crossed us off the list and moved us to the bottom. She was also very rude to us about it. 

Whatever, no big deal. I'll take your attitude, just seat me, I'm starving. 

Finally after waiting for a few minutes (this time I stood near their hostess station so they knew I was in existence) and my party was seated. Naturally it was uncomfortably hot but we were seated in probably the worst area. It was so hot, I was disgustingly (and embarrassingly) taking ice out of my drink and letting it melt on my legs. :hangs head in shame:

Our waiter was very nice and made up for the hostess. I wanted lunch and asked for something ""small."" Apparently their tuna salad was the smallest salad but this thing was massive!!! It was very good, but I'm still cautious about getting fish in the middle of the desert.

Me, my fiancé, and her mother went to Le Mont for dinner tonight in hopes of locking down a date for our wedding venue next year. Well, I definitely would have thrown my money at them if I wanted countless disappointing memories and an over the top, pretentious, unprofessional, outdated venue.

Le Mont reminds me of a restaurant that made it big in the past with presumably good food, service, and professionalism while of course being complemented by the unmatched view of Pittsburgh. However, complacency must have set in because all of those characteristics were lost along the way.

Upon arrival, we were not greeted with even a hello. We were standing waiting for our table while one of the staff members motioned over to us (while standing deep within the restaurant) to come follow him. If it wasn't for my fiancé paying attention his efforts would have been useless, while remaining devoid of professionalism.

Our waitor clearly lacked proper training for a place of this caliber. Nothing against him, but if you work hard during the week to go to a restaurant and pay hundreds of dollars for dinner, you would like a waitor that is professional, knowledgeable about the menu, and attentive. For example, he asked me if I would like another cocktail as it was 3/4 finished. I said yes as I proceeded to finish it; meanwhile he waited behind me as I finished the drink and said: ""Oh I'm just waiting for you to finish so I can make you another drink in the same glass."" WHAT!??!!?

I ordered the filet mignon and said I wanted it between medium and medium rare. His response: ""Well I'll just have them cook it medium rare and if it's undercooked for you I'll have them cook it a little bit more."" WHAT!??!!

The side vegetables were 100% frozen and just came out of the microwave, and lacked any effort of seasoning to help disguise its origin, the grocery store shelf.

When it was time for dessert, they brought out a food cart of half eaten cakes that looked like they had been raided by a hungry pack of wolves. But, in any attempt to salvage the night, me and my fiancés mother ordered a slice of cake. The waitor asked my fiance if she wanted anything and she said no because she was full. His response: ""You sure you don't want nuttin?"" WHAT!??! 

I ordered a cappuccino which lacked foam and had burnt coffee inside. To top it off, the plate was ""beautifully garnished"" with a shriveled, small, dirty, lemon peel. ""Yes, I love lemon with my coffee."" When I confronted the waitor about it, he indeed confirmed that it was a garnish. WHAT?!?!?!?!!? 

The bathrooms were dirty, floors were sticky, wall paper was peeling, and outdated. On the way out, no ""have a good night, thank you for coming, etc"" was said. Pretty fitting though - with this poor excuse for a 5 star restaurant I would expect nothing more: lack of professionalism, mediocre precooked food, and ridiculous comments about lemon peels, but definite willingness to take your money.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT. IT NEEDS GORDON RAMSEY, OR A BULLDOZER. SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ELSEWHERE.

JUST GOOGLE THE VIEW.",16,1h6YEViaFaRvtOC96YSqgw

They told me it would be forty-five minutes to an hour before it would get here, no problem, it is what it is. After waiting for TWO hours my very polite coworker called to inquire about our order. A man answered the phone and she said, ""I was calling to check on an order"", without asking for a name or what we ordered he said, ""it's on its way"", and he HUNG UP on her. What a bastard!! 15 to 20 minutes later the delivery guy showed up, he was very nice. We couldn't accurately judge if the tardiness was his fault, so unfortunately he was tipped well. After exchanging the money and food we walked to the back because we were starving at this point. My coworker and I have a security camera system set up and we noticed the delivery guy hanging out in the lobby. We stood there and watched the guy pace our lobby pick up a few magazines, flip through them, watch the TV for a solid minute. My coworker and I were actually laughing. At this point being mad wouldn't make it better. However sharing my experience on Yelp would potentially help the next guy know not to order from here for Delivery. The food was was almost room temperature. The cashew chicken that I had ordered had very little chicken (I had to hunt for it to make sure there was any even in the dish!). It didn't lack giant chunks of onion. I like onion, but damn! A coworker had sushi that she didn't even eat after a few pieces, saying it was not good. I did try it, I didn't like it, but that opinion can be taken with a grain of salt due to the fact I'm not a fan in the first place.  -3 stars is my real rating. -1 star for the bastard -1 star for the smug delivery driver and last but certainly not least -1 star for the shitty food.

I was SUPER hungry before stepping into the restaurant. I checked in on Yelp for a 10% discount and I was ready-to-go.

I want to emphasize just how hungry I was in order to reveal the accuracy of my 4/5 review. Despite just how hungry I was, the food wasn't THAT impressive. It was standard in terms of quality and portion.

FOOD:
I got a See Yew spice level 3 (out of 10) with chicken. It was tasty and well-cooked! There wasn't much of a wow-factor though. I tried a bit of my friends' food, and my opinion stands accurate for all the dishes.

ATMOSPHERE:
Spacious. There's a bar area. Lots of seating, not as many customers (I went on a Saturday night). However, it's nice and clean. There's also a sanitary bathroom for paying customers.

SERVICE:
The waitress was really nice and helpful. She was patient and friendly the whole night. Someone from the kitchen, who I presume to be the owner and/or head chef came out to make sure everything was okay ... and that's really telling of how much the staff care.

When I first inquired about the repair cost, I was told it'd be $35.00. The repair was done in a timely fashion. When I went to pick it up, the cost came up to $120.00. I was in shock and had to re-budget my rent for this month for this shocking repair cost. But I did pay for it. 

A week later, the same gasket was torn. (And yes I do take care of them, my head is as small as a child and I even sanded down my nails to prevent any harm to the suit gaskets). I was very upset as I just spent all that money and time on it. This is also the time of the year when I need the drysuit the most. 

As there is a repair warranty, I took the suit back to MEC and politely asked for help. The rep at service desk was very pleasant and helpful. And promised to take care of the repair without charge, under warranty and that the suit would be ready in a few days. Later that day, I received a call from a MEC manager to tell me that's not going to happen and accused me of taking advantage of the shop for multiple gaskets repairs and not paying for them. That they do not cover wear and tear. Wear and tear? It was worn 3 times and was torn again! As if it's normal for their service to hold up for 3 wears. Did I mention the drysuit was $1000.00? And the neck gasket can only be repaired/changed 3 times. 

We came to an agreement that they will cover the repair cost but have no idea when it will be repairs as no one at the shop is willing to do it. So my drysuit is currently sitting in the shop without action and I am cancelling all my paddling plans for the next few weeks and a long October vacation trip.

To their credit, they seem to have a good stock on different bowling balls and supplies, but I had a very crappy experience going there. Walked in to browse and see what they had and for a good 10 minutes I walked around and not a single person greeted or even asked if I needed help. There looked to be 3-4 people behind the counter as well so I was kinda taken back by the lack of customer service. Maybe I just came at a bad time, but I can't sugar coat it. Glad to see a local shop doing well, but I'm not sure when or if I'll come back. Didn't see what I was looking for either. Wish their business the best.",0,xv-N4fanW7i4Twm_qNtF0g

Wen whe got there they had attituted with us so we had to go back to tbe car and sleep there because they didnt do anything to help with the problem. And wen we went back to register they told us that the room was gonna be ready until 12. When we went baxk at twelve they told us the room was gonna be ready until 3. So we went to sit down at a couch in the hotel. If it wasnt for someone from security that was tired of seeing us wait so he got us the room.

Not the case here! You'd think with such a fantastic special that the services would be skimpy or cut-rate, but again, not the case!

Here is what we ordered:

Kobe beef carpaccio- OMG WIN! WIN! WIN! The beef was thin and delicious covered in truffle oil, parmesean, and arugula. The portion was really large. I am sorry that I didn't just order 5 plates of this for myself instead of the steak trio...I would have been much happier.

Rare Steak Trio for Two - the trio consists of a filet mignon, new york strip, and kobe hangar steak. We ordered the steaks medium rare but only the filet was cooked properly...we had to kick back the NY and hangar. The filet was like butter and really delicious. It took a ridiculously long time to get our other 2 steaks back. They eventually arrived at the correct temperature but the hangar steak was inedible because it was so stringy and tough.

Rare 120 Herbed Fries - good fries covered in chives, thyme, parsley, and rosemary.

We were celebrating a birthday and they brought us out a trio of mini desserts (german chocolate cake, brownie smores,  and tiramisu) with candles on top which was very nice.

Our server was very friendly, attentive, and professional. The manager came out and apologized about the steaks. Best part of the evening was that they were showing the movie Flashdance on the wall.

I liked that they would make a cuppa of whatever they sold (rather than ""this is the flavor of the day"") and even though $4.99 is a bit steep for a cuppa, it is a one-time leaning experience and is helpful in learning whether you want to take this tea home or not.

Nor does not have stunning water nymph dances found in ""La Reve"".

This circus features a poignant collection of delirious jugglers, bawdy clowns, a number of dauntless acrobats who defy physics and human endurance, a defeated mad scientist and his coterie of believers, and a pickled mutated baby that acts as the lead float in its sideshow parade. 

Although the performances in ""Zarkana"" are very much old school and emphasize its audacious acts and astonishing acrobatics, this show is in no way reminiscent of the Circus Vargas that sets up its tent in your neighborhood mall's parking lot. 

It is far more prodigious, where almost every performance will leave you gasping with awe and wonder, and garnished in typical Cirque fashion with ostentatious costumes, a score of pandemoniac songs that both lull and excite you, and eerie video and images that are projected all around its stage that give ""Zarkana"" both a Gothic and Steampunk vibe.",1,DB8eZawJlQxbWc2I7aJ_vQ

Every month I have to call in an order for my infant son's formula. Every month I have to fight with them in order to get the order shipped to me. The first thing I'm told is they denied the order because they don't have the medical necessity on file yet after fighting with them they review the file and find out. Then the order gets stopped in billing due to the same missing documentation. I'm always informed that they will update the file and they don't follow through. Numerous times I've called my insurance company to talk to edgepark with me on the line and supposedly is fixed. On the 1st I call in and low and behold they need the medical necessity. I seem to get the run around. They continually put my order on a hold I'm constantly having to tell them I'm on his last can and by the time I recieve the shipment my 6 month old infant out down to his last few bottles. Why?  How can a company be so incompetent that they cannot update the information on file that they already have in the system?  Why do I have to fight with them every single month?  This past month I called on the 27th to place the order. Customer service supposedly sends the order 4 days pass no package I called back they said I never placed an order. I get switched from one person to another they finally fess up that the order was rotated through 4 customer service reps and then canceled. Why wasn't I informed?  No phone call no email nothing to inform me of the issue. I call on the 1st it's another 2 hour phone call of they need this info they need that it's being held up my coding now it's being held up by billing. Finally the issue is resolved they are sending out formula I recieve an email and surprise I'm only getting half my order. Why?  Today is another merry go round I've talked to probably 10+ reps nobody has an answer and the issue still isn't resolved. Save yourself the stress and go with a different company. Edgepark doesn't care about their customers who depend on them to provide services that they bill insurance for. They show no compassion and no initiative to resolve issues as they arise. This company will do nothing more than frustrate you with every conversation.

They are so incredibly friendly, and I am glad that this hasn't changed. (Also, we had some broccoli in our Hibachi meals this time, and it was a really inspired addition! I hope that they keep it up.)

We tried a few new things today. My son said that his order of Spicy chicken was excellent. My husband really enjoyed his scallops, which were nicely browned and seared but still moist and juicy on the inside. The Lobster and Shrimp combo (my order) did not disappoint either. The lobster was sweet and nicely seared (not the usual treatment that Canadians use for lobster, so be prepared - I loved it). The shrimp was as great as ever.  To my taste, Hibachi's signature yum yum sauce is best suited to meats, and their homemade spicy sauce pairs well with seafood.  

How do they achieve that beautifully seared, flavourful exterior without turning the seafood to rubber? I sure can't do it at home, which makes Hibachi Grill the perfect take-out for a busy night.

I was quoted a fixed price for moving things so when they came and worked slowly, I mean it is pretty obvious they were dragging their feet.  I've hired many movers in my life and in my 20 years of hiring movers, I've never seen anyone move this slow.  Not only did they move slow, they decided to wrap my furniture 10 times and did it at a snail's pace.  I didn't complain at first because I was quoted a fix price.

When they finished, they actually said it was by the hour and $144.00/hr at that for 3 guys.  This was the first time I heard of that.  The whole job on day 1 took 9 hours including driving time.  However they charged me an extra hour for driving, even though 9 hours already included driving time.  They said this is their standard practice (of bilking customers).

If I had known, I would have hired much cheaper and honest movers.  Total cost for a local move, $2,900.  They quoted about $1,300.  They even had the nerve to ask me for a review.  So here it is.  They even asked for a tip saying that most people are too cheap to give them one.  I could have hired guys in front of home depot for $500.",13,1i3WvtGsIW8FGOFLvHHFMw

Skewers ranges from $2.99 - $6.99. Most items have the same flavour; salt, chili pepper, and cumin. Every item started tasting the same after the first two or three skewers. It masks the natural flavours of the ingredients. 

Similar to other reviewers, my favorite is the Enokitake mushroom skewer and Korean Cabbage. My family did not enjoy any of the meat skewers. They felt lamb skewers lacked the gamey flavour of lamb, beef skewers lacked the earthy flavour of beef. Lastly, chicken gizzard and squid tentacles skewers were very tough. As well, my father felt they used a natural gas grill instead of a traditional charcoal grill.

""Had brunch at the Fig on Sunday. Ordered a Bloody Mary and an orange cocktail (acceptable). Also ordered Biscuits & Gravy (good) and Migas (okay). But what killed our experience was the HORRENDOUS service.  

Our server, Josh, was distracted and did not check on us.  When he did come he did not demonstrate knowledge of the menu.  I asked which he would recommend, between the omelette and Migas.  He ummed, ahhed, and failed to provide a coherent response. When the food came he did not see if the items were to our liking. When we asked for the check he delivered it and then failed to come back for our credit card in a timely manner. He walked by our table several times before I flagged him down in desperation.

Can a single meal radically alter your relationship with food in general?

I think it can -- and Sage proves it.  After my dinner here, I'll never look at food quite the same way again.  To say it was my favorite meal in Las Vegas would be an understatement.  It would be more accurate to say it was one of my top meals of *all time*.

It began with an 8pm reservation for two.  Sage, located in the Aria hotel, has a relatively unassuming entrance, but that belies that grandeur to be found inside.  The restaurant is immense, with high ceilings, sumptuous furnishings, and a gorgeous color scheme with lots of golds accents and stunning chandeliers.  Needless to say, Sage is just as much a feast for the eyes as it is for the taste buds. 

After we were seated, our incredibly friendly and kind server, John, came by with the breadbasket.  We each had the sourdough roll and a bacon brioche -- and both were excellent.  They were served with sea salt (served on a tablespoon) and whipped butter. 

Deciding what to order was easy as pie -- we both had the 4-course tasting menu ($79).  My dinner companion splurged on the wine pairing ($39).  Our server's wine pours were *very* generous -- a lot more than the advertised half glass per course .  In fact, I was able to enjoy some wine with every course without bothering to order the wine pairing myself. 

Below is a run-down of everything that we ate.  Absolutely everything was cooked and presented with the utmost class and sophistication.  The refinement of this dinner was unlike anything I'd previously experienced.

**AMUSE BOUCHE ... PRE-DINNER**
A shot glass of gazpacho.  Fresh and tangy.  A wonderful starter.

**COURSE #1**
Wagyu beef tartare with buttered crostini.  Easily the finest tartare I've ever had.  The beef was unctuous and fresh; the egg only added to the indulgence.  Chocolate shavings provided an unexpected layer of complexity.

**COURSE #2**
Seared Maine dayboat scallops with broccolini, braised oxtail, mushrooms, and caramel reduction.  The scallops were cooked beautifully and fall apart when touched with a fork.  The broccolini was tender.  The caramel sauce provided an intriguing sweetness that contrasted against the saltiness of the shellfish.

**COURSE #3**
48 hour beef belly with braised apples.  I've never had beef this tender and succulent in my life.  Each bite dissolves on your palate and overwhelms you with flavor.  Apples provide a gentle acidity that works well against the umami of the beef.

**COURSE #4**
Pistachio tart with strawberry ice cream.  A culinary work of art -- oodles of individual components meticulously arranged.  Bold, fresh flavors all over the plate.  An enjoyable juxtaposition of hot and cold. 

**AMUSE BOUCHE ... POST-DINNER**
Hot white chocolate with mint and coconut, served in a white porcelain shot glass.  A sweet, uplifting treat at the end of a fantastic meal.

After this meal, I wasn't just full and satisfied -- I was exhilarated, knowing that I had a world-class gastronomic experience.  The staff at Sage earned every penny of their tip.

This isn't the sort of meal I can have everyday -- but it's worth doing once in a while, if for no other reason to remind yourself that fine dining can truly be life-changing.

If you subscribe to the ""you only live once"" philosophy, than a dinner at Sage is a must.",9,0C65lVj_ujVYDs7b2yYBAA

RsREl3LkFGiwbt3kGIX4Eg,2,2008-06-02 02:13:18,3,gU2x1aj93Fc6qua7HZZLZA,3,"Okay, honestly, Honey Bear's couldn't hang in Memphis, Birmingham, Houston, or Lockhart  ... and fortunately for them, they don't need to 'hang' because they are smoking their meats in the BBQ wasteland of Phoenix, AZ.  

Because I fancy myself a BBQ expert (note: I'm more of a brisket purist), its difficult to rate HB's based on the integrity of the THEIR OWN meat and not as a comparison to others Valley and Nation-wide. This is exactly 'why' I think many of their rating suffer because everyone has undoubtedly had better BBQ elsewhere, wherever you may hail from, and it takes a stringent push from one's own natural reflexes to resist matching HBs up to 'local awesome BBQ joint'.  BBQ connoisseurs are funny like that.

So, overall, HB's earns a 3-star based on the following:

Pork Ribs - I'm more of a beef rib expert, but these ribs were generous and plentiful in their combo plate.  I was surprised that there was very likely a whole half-rack on my plate.  They are very tasty even without the sauce, with a nice peppery rub that did not dry out the meat.

Smoked Chicken - Juicy but slightly greasy.  This is amongst the most difficult smoked meat to pull off due to the propensity for it to become a stringy, dehydrated mess.  I don't think I would order it again, but the flavor was pretty decent and I don't regret trying it.

Pulled Pork - I got a 1/2 lb of pulled pork as a side meat, along with a couple of extra buns to make as a half-sandwich (a glob of meat on a half bun, folded over like a taco).  This is the only time I typically use sauce to counterbalance the white bread, whether its pork, brisket, or sausage.  I was surprised by how dry the pork was, particularly because pork is fatty and juicy, but here at HB's it was extra lean.  I thought I would hate the pork bc of this fact, but the sauce saves it from being a choking bolus of pig and flour.  Now I understand why they typically put this on a full bun and drown it in sauce.  As the 'specialty' of this restaurant, its kind of a gaffe that the quality is poor, but as a consumer, I'd order it again in limited amounts, and only as a 'side'.  Why?  Because I can provide my own perfect ratio of bread:pork:sauce.  Otherwise, I don't think that HB's could build me a pulled pork sandwich I could be happy with.

Sauce - If you don't know any better you'd think it was tip-top.  Sure, its 'pretty good', but its most-definitely a one-note mixture.  Too sweet for their peppery rubs.  A spicier sauce would do the trick better, IMO.

Corn on the Cob - Serviceable, but soggy and strangely devoid of spices typical of southern cuisine.

Cowbro Beans - Awesome.  Smokey flavor, thick sauce, and chunks of their smoked sausage.  Great compliment to a BBQ dinner.

Soda Fountain - The city's best.  BBQ restaurant staples such as 1a) Dr Pepper 1b) Big Red.  Their 'cola' is RC and they have Hines Rootbeer, Sunkist, Country Time Lemonade, and 7-Up.  They did some solid research on the fluid necessities of BBQ palates.  They also have a fridge of beer.

Price -  All that, which I described above came out to $33 with a large tip because the guy behind the counter was very cool.  It fed two hungry people during the season finale of LOST, with plenty extra for leftovers.  Very pleased in this area.

Overall - Hey, its PHX, and here we are better adapted to 'fill-ins' for our favorite spots back home.  It happens in every culinary category, from philly cheesesteaks to fish n chips; gnocchi to Q.  Why should this place be any different?",2,kc-rnN-ndnFTdHG4TfIgeQ

I ordered an L.A Mac and cheese. It came in a skillet which was pretty cute...although with that price tag I should have got to keep the skillet $14 dollars for such a small portion... I'm a broke uni student so I'm just thinking how many McDoubles can I buy with that. Other than that the Mac & cheese was creamy gooey and artery clogging.

Sweet potato fries were pretty standard. Sorbet was good but could be made at home.

For 9 months I had always, always scheduled with the same two technicians.. one does my mani and the other my pedi simultaneously. I scheduled with both, signed in and indicated both their names and I also told the front desk that I am scheduled with both ladies. I was called back by the lady who does my pedicures and she stared my manicure instead. I was confused but I assumed the front desk arranged this because my manicure lady had just starts applying polish a few seats away on another customer. I had no problem with that and was willing to stay a little longer because I knew it was worth having the lady do both. Front desk came by and apologized for not telling the technician that I had scheduled with both and that it would take longer. I had no problem because mix ups happen and it was the first mishap anyway. As the lady is doing my pedicure she asked why I didn't notify her that someone else is doing my manicure. This caught me off guard and told her I thought it's what the front desk arranged. She raised her voice said no and that it was my job to tell her this info. I advised that it was a misunderstanding and again she raised her voice and said ""next time, you have to tell me"" in a very rude tone and I had about 4-5 technicians along with their customers staring at me. I finally snapped back raising my voice and told her to stop raising her voice at me because i don't work there and it isn't my responsibility to arrange it and she can discuss it with the front desk. I felt SO uncomfortable. I only go to her because her work is so clean regardless of the fact that in the last 9 months she can't even manage to look me in the face and say hi. She decided to be nice after and call me ""sweetie"" and ""love"" when time came to pay. I won't put up with that fakeness and rude attitude. I'd rather she not talk to me at all and just fix my nails rather than talk to me as if I owe her something. Owners weren't there so I'm leaving this review because this info probably never got to them even after I called and complained. Oh and the techs were arguing over who was going to do my pedi.

Besides the steaks some of my companions also enjoyed their black cod. We wanted to share with our guests the pride of the Montreal cuisine, the roast beef poutine. The poutine was a little bit disappointing, fries were kind of cold and the roast beef presence was minimal. I guess we shocked the chef with that order.

Music: They seem to play whatever's popular, nothing niche or anything like that.

Dance floor: It's a long narrow rectangle in the middle of the main floor, so we prepared for a highway down the middle of people walking from one end to the other. Upstairs is small and usually has a private party going on, but when it doesn't it plays a different style of music (depending on who's DJ'ing sometimes it's better/worse than downstairs).

Clientele: Kind of a bit on the douchy side, but there's a mixed variety here, and it really depends on the night (if there's a special event going on for example).

Patio: I've gotta admit their patio is amazing.  It was decent before, but they've renovated and now it's just massive.  It's big enough i can go out there to relax and get a break from the dance floor; even as a non-smoker i barely notice that everyone is smoking. If i was only rating their patio they'd get 5/5.

Dress code: you can get in with pretty much anything if you're not too drunk, judging by all the graphic tee's.  They sometimes restrict sneakers (if they're busy) but mostly they don't care if you can afford the $20 cover.  If you're in a blazer you'll be the best dressed person in there.

Bottle service: the one time we got bottle service here we had a blast until we went to go dance.  We left our half-finished bottle with the bartender, and when we returned to claim it they told us it had been finished when we dropped it off. With a group of drunk guys i suppose it's possible, but we all agreed that there was definitely SOMETHING left in our bottle when we dropped it off.",1,Ip7GdJmVv1Ju0fsol7y5mQ

But I just want to add THEIR SANDWICHES ARE DELICIOUS!! The grilled chicken is freaking amazing! The filling they use is so good! And curry chicken is unexpectedly delicious too!

I FOUND MY HEAVEN. I loooooooooooove cafes where I can sit and enjoy their goodies in peace. I don't like visiting a beautiful coffee shop and feel like people are rushing me. Because I can make my own good coffee at home, you know? Why would I bother coming to a coffee shop if I can't stay?

Mamie Clafoutis makes incredible pistachio croissants and almond croissants, as well as cookies and tonssssss of bread. PLUS they have lots and lots and lots of comfortable seating upstairs. The tables are big enough for a computer and a Wacom tablet, messy papers and pencils, textbooks, and my food and coffee. This is bigger than my desk at home! Also lots of OUTLETS!! LOTS OF POWER!!!!!!!!!! 

I originally wanted to do a Sherbrook station bakery hop, but I visited Mamie Clafoutis first and never left. It's so comfortable here that I called my friend, and we both studied here. The table is big enough for both our stuff.

This is, in fact, my heaven. Washrooms are clean. Wifi is not super fast when more people are here, but it is faster than Starbucks and 100% working. Staff is absolutely wonderful. The smell of the bakery is delightful, so feel free to watch the kitchen from upstairs!

The pistachio croissant plus cafe au lait is about $8. But this isn't the typical airy and tiny croissant. The croissant is quite filling and heavy! I looooooved mine. The almond is good too!",12,LQG9wFTmscbAATp8QWj1hg

Upon getting there, they gave me a room with the Ferris wheel view, and would not accommodate what I had originally purchased. They stated those rooms were full. 

Pros- The location of the strip is great, its in the heart of the strip, with 4 star hotels and casinos near by. Its also near a lot of restaurants and a couple clubs. The outdoor lighting of the flamingo gives it a lot of spunk. 

Cons- The room I had was pretty dark, but the overall cleanliness wasn't something to go home talking about. You get what you pay for here. I wish there was a way I could've got my money back for a night, due to the TV not working. I asked the front desk and nobody ever showed up and they did not change my room. The room was ""non smoking"" but smelled like the previous guests had smoked in there. There were cob webs on the window. 
The shower pressure was very low and there was a roach on the floor. I wish I had taken pictures but we spent most of the time outside of the room.

When we arrived, the receptionist took us back to a manicurist station and painted my niece's nails in about 4 minutes, and then grabbed her feet from under the table and painted them.

My fiance and I decided to try Passage to India today for lunch. We ordered the Chicken 65 for our appetizer. It was definitely not authentic, it was below average, too much cumin in my opinion and way too much cilantro. But the chicken was tender. We ordered it medium, it was fairly bland ( and I can't really eat spicy food).

I ordered the Chicken Biryani (boneless) and my fiance ordered the Chicken vindaloo, both medium spice level as well. I assumed boneless meant chicken breast, not dark meat without the bone. If I knew that was the case I would not have ordered it and paid extra for boneless chicken. It was full of cilantro (no brown onions at all) and it was more or a bland pulao than biryani. The rice was dry and undercooked and stale tasting. The waitress actually forgot to bring out the rice that is complimentary with the vindaloo and we ended up waiting about 10 minutes till we found another waiter who brought it out for us. This rice too was cold and stale. It definitely was not basmati (didn't have the smell or taste of basmati). Both dishes had no flavor, the vindaloo didn't taste anything like the peppery vinegary dish it was meant to taste like. I have a hard time believing the cooks are Indian.

While walking around the Chandelier Bar on the upper floors, I stumbled across a long hallway lined with album covers, with a questionable ending.  What could be at the end? Narnia? Or the Springfield Mystery Spot, complete with Ozzie Smith? Of course, being the quizzical individual that I am, I walked down the hallway.  Couldn't believe what I saw...a walk-up pizza joint!

Anyway, with over 500 reviews, I don't know how this is a secret anymore.  No sign, no advertising, but excellent NY-style pizza.  At $4.50/slice, with the Strip-markup, it's a pretty good value for wasteepants late-night munchies.  And if you're not ready to end the rager, they have beer and I think, boxed wine.

This is obviously a place to go after a night throwin elbows at the club.  At times, I've seen the line full of button-down shirts, fist pumps, sky-high heels, and dresses that leave little to the imagination.  Sometimes the line is long, which is understandable given its popularity.  But they try their best to keep the line moving swiftly.

After several attempts to go to the restaurant (they have weird hours, closed a lot of days and close early some days), we finally went on a Friday night.  You get to go in and choose your type of BBQ sauce to put on your meat.  My husband and I each got pulled pork sandwiches with different BBQ sauces.  

What a disappointment!  Like one reviewer said, I wanted to love it but it was not very good.  The pork was incredibly dry and had a weird, greasy consistency at the same time.  My mac and cheese side was really mushy and not very flavorful.  It was a really disappointing experience.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong thing?

You start your meal at their 40 item salad bar, which is delicious.  It has traditional salad toppings, a variety of pasta salads, interesting vegetables, spanish cheeses, and more.

The meat is the best part though.  They have nine different cuts on any given night, and the cooks come around and slice you off some of whichever meat they are passing around.  The top sirloin was a perfect medium rare and probably their best meat.  The duck was delicious, the flank steak had amazing seasonings on it, and the bacon wrapped tenderloin tasted great.  The rack of lamb had a little too much garlic, but other than that was pretty good and both the leg of lamb and the parmesan pork were delicious.

A family run business where the husband is front of house and the wife and another chef do the cooking. The food is prepared with pride and love and was delicious. For a newly opened restaurant the service was seamless - and even more than that - friendly and generous as we were given an additional appetiser dish on the house. It was a mushroom salad with yuzu dressing that wasn't on the menu but the chef wanted us to try it - and it should be! 
We ordered the Korean pancake (vegetarian), the beef bulgogi, 2x bibimbaps, the tofu and kimchi stew (a fave), and the sweet potato glass noodles (another fave!) and there was plenty of food! Along with the complimentary mushroom salad, we were given kimchi, and some pickles to start and also had cold roasted corn tea (delicious!) so I would say this was a very well priced meal around $25 per person. The food was all very tasty and the portions were generous - we were 5 and we had plenty to try from each dish.

As we were seated and given our menus, the hostess informed us that ""the best table in the house"" was available, and led us to a comfy, cozy, well-lit booth in the back of the restaurant. We're off to a good start so far, I thought to myself. 

But we were only just beginning. 

Our server was very polite and knowledgeable, and the food...was excellent. The portion sizes weren't tiny, but they weren't huge. The spinach salad was perfectly dressed, not overpowering at all, but subtle enough to be noticed. Our entrees were delicious! You can absolutely tell the freshness of the pasta.  Although I will say, the gnocchi was a little soft for our liking. We'll give them a pass though, because the espresso martini may have been the best martini I've ever had. And I didn't think I'd say that about a place in Champaign.

Under my table, I looked because my child had dropped a crayon, it looked like days worth of old food, crumbs and other debris.  The reason I say this is their were a few Hooters girls on ""break"" taking care of one of their kids while supposedly working while their significant other was there sitting in front of us, for over an hour while other girls continued to sit with them, one of whom was our waitress.  (mind you only one other table had anyone at it.) The manager on duty also took part in this.

I had 2 chicken wings out of six in which I found hairs coming in and out of the breading,  (I shave my head so 100% not mine.)

This was my very first purchase on my own as a 24-year-old woman. My family has purchased multiple cars via him. He is the best dealer at this Hyundai location and really goes above and beyond for his customers. Unfortunately, the customer service provided by his fellow peers do not match his. Hopefully, the story below will defer first time buyers like me away from a bad dealership with terrible customer service. 

7/31 Took a hiking trip and made it back home safely when this brand-new car under 7,000 miles battery died. This was odd for me because it is a brand-new car so I didn't understand why the car just died. All my key fobs were not working and no power to the entire car. At this point I was fine because I knew it would be fixed under the warranty. Called Antonio to let him know what was going on, he advised me that I had roadside assistance for 5 years so I called to get the battery jumped, and it didn't work so Antonio asked me to bring the car to the dealership. After arriving there I was immediately greeted (if that's what you call it) with distasteful customer service. A service clerk named Linda chastised me and the representative from the towing company with a negative tone basically asking why we were there and blocking her service area instead of directing us where we needed to go, saw that we were being serviced already and passed us off in an extremely rude manner. Mind you I later saw her help three other customers with the exact opposite kind of attitude, so it's not like she was having a bad day, I'm assuming we were just a problem for her. My normal service representative was busy so I was passed off to another rep to assist in getting a courtesy car. I had to go to get the car myself, and also received it with no gas, after telling the rep three times, he then had it filled. No one asked if I needed help with anything else, or told me when I should be expecting my vehicle, NO ONE ASKED ME FOR THE KEY TO MY CAR AT A CAR DEALERSHIP, and my problems seemed to be an inconvenience to every and anyone at the dealership.

8/2 Went to pick-up the vehicle and showed up with no one inside the facility. After searching, I found the General Manager of the branch who proceeded to walk me to the service area to get my vehicle, I knew he had heard of my experience previously, so out of knowledge of ""good"" customer service, I expected him to ask what happened, but he seemed to show no interest in it. After receiving my vehicle, I told the manager I wouldn't be returning, and all I got was an uninterested ""Sad to hear it,"" and I drove off of the lot. I'm usually not the type to speak on bad service but previously, I've recommended this place to many family members and friends, so I'm doing this in hopes that no one will have to deal with this kind of service again.",5,hThXXWAByYfKIEgKQr7L0A

I asked him some technical questions with no intent to purchase a system.  A follow up meeting at my house by one of the sales team answered my remaining questions.  It seemed almost too good so I told them I would think about it.  I called some of the other solar installers in Las Vegas and told them the deal.   They told me that they couldn't even come close and would not return my calls for a formal quote.  Yes, that is absolutely true!

We opted to buy out the lease outright which gives us a solar system for 20 years with free maintenance and support the whole time.  The equipment is theirs but I think it's much like a cell phone.  You'll want to upgrade before the end of 20 years anyways.  I calculate my cost to be 8.55 cents per kw/hr compared to that of 13.1 cents per kw/hr of NV Energy.  We only get a $14 bill from the power company now; which is well worth it for the net metering service they provide (which means every ounce of unused solar power produced by the system can be sent to the grid for later use) .  No other costs as everything for the next 20 years was paid upfront.    

I know they are new in town and they wanted to make a good impression with the new trucks and equipment, but they followed through with installers that were exceptionally professional.  They kept me informed during every part of the installation.   They installed the system in only a few days and I was very happy with the end result; both with the solar panel placement on the roof and the inverter placement inside the garage (my preference).

Because I signed up when they were at Costco, we received coupons for free Costco membership renewal and a $500 Costco card.   It takes a while to get both, but they came without me asking for them.

I just couldn't be happier and I don't normally write reviews.  I do, however, use Yelp a lot to decide on services for the house, so I just thought I would take a few minutes and contribute.  I would do this again with SunRun ""in a minute"".  Take a bow SunRun.",0,X65hVqCXd5ukNhtb-PpiaA

We have noticed, however, at that in the past few weeks they have unfortunately decreased the number of servers thing to one person. It takes forever to try to order something, or get the bill, and get the machine for the bill. You don't get checked on as frequently, and usually the waiter on staff, the only waiter, isfrantically trying to serve the customers, and clearly is trying to do the best that they can. 

I think management should consider adding 2 Waiters for the evening service at a minimum, so that the customer service doesn't decline as a result.

f_eiOrEcMnkHB7GvQVOHkQ,1,2009-03-25 14:12:47,0,YXwjMPLuXTwCVzvjoIeWmg,2,"Having seen that the line for the Wynn Buffet was at least a good hour and a half long, my friends and I headed a little further down the hall to the Terrace Pointe Cafe.  The wait was only about 15 minutes; we were seated, given menus, and waited about another 15 minutes for our waitress to come over.  

Once she did she was very pleasant, and got our orders in promptly.  I started with the tomato bisque, which was advertised as coming with a mini grilled cheese sandwich.  Maybe because I got the cup instead of the bowl, it didn't come with one.  The soup was WAY too sweet, but otherwise had good texture, and a nice background kick.  

My entree was sorely disappointing.  I got the carne asada, which was pieces of skirt steak wrapped in corn tortillas with chopped onions and cilantro.  It came with a tomato rice, a tortilla bowl filled with pinto beans and melted cheese, and a little side of salsa.  It was all just so...bla.  Nothing about it was bad; it just wasn't that good.  The tomato rice was probably the most flavorful thing on the plate.  The portion was also way too large.

My dessert was the best part of the meal.  I got the cheesecake sampler, which came with three mini cheescakes on a plate- one plain with 2 fresh blackberries on top, one mango with fresh mango chunks on top, and the other chocolate with a truffle.  The mango was the best out of the three, although the plain was a close second, with a true New York cheesecake flavor and nice graham cracker crust.  My cafe latte was  large and very hot, which is nice since they can often be lukewarm.

The service from start to finish was super sloooow.  It took us TWO HOURS to eat lunch, and we are not slow eaters.  And considering that the delicious Wynn buffet was only $30 for the champagne brunch that day, the $45 + tip that I paid for this mediocre meal was really painful.

The one high point of the experience was the decor and ambiance of the place.  Like the rest of the Wynn, it is fresh, bright, and quirky.  I loved the white plates with sunny yellow borders, the oversized yellow coffee cups, the denim-looking napkins, and the lime green couch with navy border at the entrance.  The lower part of the seating area overlooks the beautiful pool.

We had originally planned to go to the Mongolian BBQ place nearby (called YC's, I think) but pulled in and realized that it would probably take too long to do the whole pick your meats, veggies, and sauce thing (we only had 20 minutes or so to get lunch and get to the field). That was when we spotted Gandolfo's and decided to give it a try. 

The menu was huge and really overwhelming, especially since we were in a hurry, but we both just picked something and ordered. He chose the New Yorker (roast beef sandwich served hot with pepper jack, feta, lettuce, tomato, onion, pepperoncini, butter, mayo, and oil and vinegar) and I got the Knickerbocker (which had roast beef, provolone, lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, oil & vinegar, and salt & pepper) served hot. 

After we paid, we ended up waiting quite a while for our sandwiches  to be prepared, especially given how few people were inside. I probably wouldn't return during a weekday lunch knowing that it's not super-speedy. If you are planning to go there for lunch, make sure it's on a day where you don't need to grab your food and be back ASAP. Maybe calling ahead would help in that case. 

Also, even though the sandwiches were definitely satisfying,  they weren't outstanding. My husband, who's originally from New Jersey, didn't think the sandwiches were nearly as good as ones he's had on the East Coast. And, yes, I know we're in Phoenix, but the restaurant (which is a chain, btw) has chosen to call itself ""New York Delicatessen,"" which in all fairness, can raise a customer's expectations! I also thought the regular size of the sandwich was a bit small. If you are a big eater, I would definitely get the large. Lest you think all I have to say about Gandolfo's sandwiches is negative, I will spend a second praising the hero roll the sandwiches came on, which was freshly baked and super satisfying. 

I would definitely eat at Gandolfo's again if I were in the area and had time to wait for a sandwich, but I'm unlikely to go out of my way for it.",6,gru76BjkRY6UQVcw_yAxiQ

One of the staff was topping up one of the dessert items so I made a comment ""Oh, I see you folks now have brownies..."" He said they've always had brownies for the lunch buffet so maybe they had run out last time I was there.

Pros:
1) AMAZING BREAKFAST.  There was freshly cut fruit and condiments of all kinds.  The best part was the made-to-order grill.  Delicious omelets with fresh veges, french toast, sausage, bacon, pancakes, and actual eggs were all made fresh in front of your eyes.
2) Well stocked gym.  It had many treadmills and ellipticals.  Free weights were also available which is kinda rare in hotels these days.
3) Shuttle bus was free and the driver could take you anywhere in a 3 mile radius including the airport.  He was even kind enough to pick me up at the baseball stadium even though it was out of the operating range.

Cons:
1) $5 / day parking fee.
2) My room smelled like the guy before smoked in there
3) The hot water in the shower took forever to heat up.  It was about 5 minutes, no joke.  I could've sworn the hotel ran out of hot water.
4) The card key readers were finicky at best.  It took at least 3 tries before I was able to open my door.  Pulling it out at different speeds didn't matter
5) The internet was also finicky.  First of all it was not free except for Hilton Gold and above members.  The internet wasn't fast and the connection would die quite often.  The wifi was so weak in the bedroom that I gave up trying to use it in there.
6) Very little counter top space at the bathroom sink.",0,h0YuVXpwDPRkNFoCKmk5_A

Was in there yesterday for a late lunch, I ordered the Seared Tuna Nicoise salad and a glass of the Caymus (or was it Caymay) chardonnay. 

The chardonnay was incredible subtle hints of fruit and a creamy finish. 

Then came the food... They brought out the seared tuna appetizer... did not order that... asked one of the bartenders what this was... it was not the salad so he took it back... then the original bartender came over to apologize.. fine whatever, but could you please ask the kitchen to put the herb dressing and ginger dressing on the side. He said sure and walked back to the kitchen... 

Ok, still waiting... finally it comes out. The salad looked lovely and fresh-really beautiful. The dressing were good (not great), but what ruined my lunch was the tuna... a piece was put on my plate that you couldn't even knife through.. WTF, this is the second time... If I had put that in my mouth, I would have lost it... I am so picky about my sushi... REALLY... the first time this happened with the salmon and now the tuna... 

Ok, so Meghan, the ultra cool manager was not there, instead it was some shitty manager. I brought the cut of meat to his attention, he apologized but reluctantly. 

That really blows... he blows... do I really ever want to go back... probably not. Well at least not for the sushi... I know better than to order sushi so far from the ocean.

I, too, have been really curious to check this place out for a while now.  Last night I got my chance.  Though it was the day-of, we still managed to secure a reservation, maybe because it was a Tuesday night.  On the phone, we got a very similar speech to the one we got when making reservations at Lee.  They will only holding the table for 15 minutes and you can only stay for two hours.  Okay fine.

We got there five minutes early and were quickly shown to our table for four.  The rest of the party arrived late, but we had ordered drinks, so no one seemed too concerned.  I ordered the apple cider and took a minute to take in the sights.  I liked the quirky interior... Victorian family portrait with one family member wearing a Stormtrooper mask - I'm feeling it.  Watching the chefs working away was fairly interesting too, though it really didn't help with the noise factor.  Even the trip to the loo was a little bit of an adventure what with all the corner turning and so on.

The food was a hit and a little miss though I really appreciated the eclectic menu.  I was lucky enough that everyone was both really hungry hence ordering a lot but also very willing to share!  The truffle oil popcorn was incredible, the tuna salad was meh,  the calamari a bit disappointing, the curried shrimp and naan very decent, the croquettes passable though I wouldn't order them again, the Fior di latte + mushrooms + truffle oil + spinach was amazing, the Burrata + pesto + eggplant + roasted red peppers was alright, and the beef hotplate was just okay.

Monday morning - line out the door, but decided to stay.  The line moved surprisingly quick.

But being the gluttons we are, we wanted to try many things so we each ordered something different. What ensued was maybe the best breakfast I've ever had. Everybody loved everything and there was indeed too much food, but it was worth it.

We're graduated now but our experience here was memorable to say the least! The puppy social class offered exactly what it stated. The room was very clean and well organized. The instructors were very helpful in answering our questions about my puppies behaviour issues I had been experiencing. Caryn is extremely sweet and you can tell she really loves what she does!

I do not believe the Southern food here is as subtle or ""elegant"" as Okra.  The food here is more down-home and hearty, with some very good dishes and a couple that were not good, but I give extra props to Chef Beckett for hosting specialty dinners and making those nights quite memorable.

I will start with the one glaring negative, and it was the gumbo.  Came for lunch and ordered the gumbo with smoked chicken and grilled andouille.  It was not good.  It lacked the depth of flavor that seafood adds to a gumbo and apart from an overwhelming smoke flavor, there was another off flavor in it that I did not enjoy.  Before this, I ordered the dirty rice balls and these were tasty.  Above average, not mind-blowing, but tasty.

My wife and I also came for two special event dinners here, and like I said, much respect to Chef for hosting.  We came to Fowl Out night for the 7 Chefs Series, and I know Chef Beckett didn't prepare mos of the dishes that night, but it came from his kitchen and the food and service were all phenomenal.  (Except, interestingly, Chef Campbell's hot chicken, which was big but not spicy or flavorful enough.)  Chef Beckett did prepare a smoked duck confit dish that night with dijon spaetzle, garlic chard, and cracklins - this dish was excellent.

The other specialty dinner was to celebrate Chef Sean Brock's new cookbook Heritage.  With recipes from the book, Chef Beckett did not disappoint, turning out dish after dish that were not just evocative of Chef Brock's style and ethos, but spot-on renditions.  My wife and I would know, since we've dined at both Husk and McCrady's.  I would say Chef Beckett's fried chicken skins that night surpassed the chicken skins we had at Husk.

As to the regular menu, the fried green tomatoes are very good, with the pea tendrils an extra plus tot his dish.  The fried okra is serviceable.  The greens were cooked enough (maybe a tad over-cooked),  and both the cider brined pork loin and catfish are quite good.  

So like I said, slight preference for Okra.  But don't fail to miss a special dinner night at Southern Rail.  Those nights tend towards the amazing.",1,KBSFwLHntHwf0e28a94ckg

We had a table of 6 I think, and were one of only a couple groups in the whole place. I'd love to see this place stay, so I'm hoping more of you will give it a try!

So first things first. Bottomless drinks. For $20 you get either bloody marys or mimosas (in several flavors far more interesting than just OJ). Our server gave us the great idea of one person ordering one, the other ordering the other, and we could mix-match to our hearts desire!

Walking into this place, you can tell it's ideally set up to handle the uptown lunch rush.  Plenty of space between the tables, is a great plus.  Even at the peak times, you can have a meal without being jostled and still be able to hear yourself think!

This is where it went downhill.  First timers here will be confused when they are handed a card, menu and wished the best of luck.  Good thing I was lunching it with two veterans.  They showed me the ropes behind the self-service concept (I assume this was supposed to be the charge of the girl at the register, but she wasn't interested).  I ordered a special off the board.  It was billed as pasta with pan fried ham, french blue cheese, arugula, and garlic. What I got was a bit different.

The chef started out by pan frying the ham.  All 4 little cubes of it.  Added the blue cheese (again, missed the portion of cheese I was supposed to get by a WIDE margin).  In what I can only assume was a little kitchen creative liberty, he then substituted spinach for the arugula (spinach = inferior greenery to the almighty arugula).  Finished off the pan sauce with not even enough of a ladle of cream to get the spinach wet!  That's OK though, because his plan all along, I guess, was to add the requisite moisture by not completely straining the pasta from the water before adding it to the pan.  End result was a bland, underseasoned bowl of pasta (and little else) sitting in water.  No bueno.  Accompanying this disappointment was bread (VERY good and fresh baked, actually) and a side salad which was served in a dish big enough to hold 4 pieces of lettuce and one crouton.  

$20 out the door (whaaaaa?).  This place is like a hibachi grill.  You aren't paying for good food.  You're paying for the entertainment of cook to order and ambiance.  Except no one juggles knives in this place.  Luce still reigns supreme for Uptown Italian, both in quality and value, by a country mile.",3,ZY3ZalGTEWp7M7clk3c8cw

Now, what I can review is the food; I decided to be not-so-adventurous and opted for the cheeseburger. Here's a breakdown:

Burger Buns: comparable to McDonalds in size, smaller than the Burger King Whopper.

Inside: pick and choose ... I don't go fancy so I had ketchup, mayo, lettuce and tomato. Some other choices? Mustard, onions, pickles, pepper, etc.

Patty: nice and crumbly homemade patty, good flavours. Nice consistency! 

Cheese: the good stuff. Doesn't taste cheap, doesn't taste like cardboard.

Filling? My colleagues usually order 2-3 burgers each... I usually get just 1 because I like it light. It's definitely a lot lighter than your usual burgers.

Sides: fries? I hear the fries aren't that great. But haven't had them, so no comment. 

Price: a burger is about $5.99; that's inexpensive for a nice gourmet burger.

The burgers were super overcooked and dry. It was as if the patties had been sitting on a grill for too long, and they were way too small for the buns. The cheese was a cold kraft single. For the price, you're better off going somewhere like Peter's. 

The regular fries are okay - they're just frozen McCain crinkle cut, but they were fresh and hot with a nice seasoning spice on them, though a bit dry.

However, after we were seated, it look about 10 minutes to get water and another 10 minutes - after signalling - to get our order placed. There were maybe three or four other tables, so I don't understand the slow service.

Food-wise, this place is nothing spectacular. We ordered a brioche for our appetizer, which was probably the best part of the meal, but it wasn't something that we couldn't recreate at home. My main course, the $17 cheese fondue stuffed pizza(?) was tasteless and small. The side salad was okay. My friend said her Margherita pizza could be found in the freezer section of Provigo.

So much so that while the Eastern location which is closest to me is closed down in preparation of a new location opening soon, I drove all the way to this location instead of just settling for the Chipotle down the street.   That's partially not true as I was somewhat in the area before deciding to get some take-out for lunch, but it was definitely much less convenient than going the Chipotle route and dammit I still took it.

This location seemed much nicer aesthetically than any other Zaba's I've been to.   That's not to say that they usually aren't nice because they are, but something about this one just seemed a step ahead.   It was packed for lunch but the employees were on top of their game in within a few minutes I was out the door with a couple Zaba Bowls to go.   

I did my usual, a zaba bowl with brown rice, shredded beef, corn, green salsa, and lettuce.   It's about as healthy a meal I can put together at any of these fresh-mex joints that I can still enjoy.   I found it to be a good version of the same thing I've gotten 100 times at the Eastern location.   The shredded beef was nicely spiced (I've had it on occasion lack spiciness which I believe is due to it not being stewed long enough to soak it all in) and the veggies were fresh and as tasty as veggies can be.   My rice was a little mushier than I normally like it, so that was my only minor gripe.   I also shared a bag of chips and they were spot on as usual.   

A good value became even better recently with the introduction of the Zaba's reward card with which every 10 entrees purchased you get the 11th free.   Points are doubled on Sundays.   Since I go to the other location at least 2-3 times a week and buy for 2, I average a free entree every 2-3 weeks.   WHAT HAS CHIPOTLE DONE FOR ME LATELY?   Exactly.",1,v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g

I'm a strange breed and, as a Native, love Mexican food of all shapes and sizes.  From greasy, gut rot Bertos, to central Mexico and New Mexican authentic, to high class more fancy Mex in Scottsdale. I love all types of regional Mexican fare.

This place sits nicely in the middle of grease and Scottsdale.  No drive through but you do order from a counter.  The nice part is that if you eat in, your food comes on a actual plate and the guy behind the counter will actually bring it to you with real silverware.

Been here a few time and each time was very good, and cheap to boot.  I recommend the Caminero burro.  Solid beans and salsa too.

Just a nice little family owned spot with a menu similar to most Mexican places with the assortment of burros, enchiladas and tacos.  They just do it a little better here than most places and certainly WAY BETTER than the ripoff, joke of a Mexican restaurant across the street, Top Shelf.

I waited at least 5 minutes to be acknowledged and seated, as the host was no where to be found.  Not a great first impression for a first time customer.  

We were seated and were promptly brought out water and menus.  Since I always get the green curry, Thai hot, and my daughter always orders the chicken skewers, we put out order in before other people had even ordered.  I requested that both dishes come out at the same time since she was eating an appetizer as an entrée.  Her order was brought out 15 minutes later, and mine came out a good 10 minutes after that.   Let me say that I was less than happy, since other tables that ordered well after I did were already being served.  

The curry was good, but was not the best that I've had.  Lacking eggplant if you ask me, but the amount of vegetables was great.  They did Thai spice very well too, as it cleared my sinuses in no time flat.  The portions are very large, definitely enough to share or bring home for another large meal the next day.  The chicken skewers were decent, cold by the time my dish came out though, so my (very picky) daughter hardly touched them after that.

As for the staff, let's just say their personalities were literally the most bland I've ever experienced.  Christ almighty, couldn't get a smile out of any of them...and I'm quite pleasant and fun!  They all seemed like they hated their job, hated life, and at any moment one of them would pull a 12 gauge from the back and start picking off staff and customers before ending it all!  

Not sure if I would come back here...the restaurant is beautiful, the food is pretty good, but aside from the great ambiance, it was lacking, to say the least.  Plus, they play terrible indie electronica music, which, between you and I, makes me think I should be in a gay bar, rather than an upscale Thai restaurant.

The restaurant was not busy but for some reason waiting seemed to be the theme of the day. When we were finally seated, we ordered drinks which took an excessively long period of time to get. Then we had to wait some more for our server took our order. She only came over after I went over to another server to ask for some help. Had I not been with my Dad, I would have left. He seemed OK with the waiting but it was 40 minutes before our order was taken...and again, it was NOT busy.  That's just unacceptable. It was another 30 minutes after we ordered for our food to come. So it was well over an hour from the time we sat down to the time our food came and we didn't order anything complicated....a couple of hot sandwiches! And when our food finally did come...it was COLD! I was SO annoyed. I mentioned it to the cashier and he just said oh I'm sorry to hear that. Ugh.

We all should have a place that we feel totally comfortable allowing folks to put sharp instruments and sand in our mouths. That is what I am reminded of every time I have an appointment. These folks make me feel totally comfortable about a necessary health task.

Their new office is beautiful and they seem to be settling in well. They could use a little more warmth (rug? color? lower lighting? fish tank?) in the new waiting room. Right now there are just chairs lined up on four white walls, a magazine rack, and a TV high up on one of the walls. A couple of big planters outside the front door would be more welcoming too.

Although I am not crazy about going to the dentist, I really am quite comfortable here when I have to go in for a cleaning, filling, or whatever needs to be done next. The staff always makes me feel welcome and as if their livelihood depended on their customers - oh, wait, it does. A lot of businesses don't get the ""customer service"" part of their business. Tempe Dental Care definitely does. Smiling friendly faces.

the pasta was served hot but lacked a little flavor 
i had the hot sausage dish

I didn't end up buying anything here or even being tempted by anything, which was a tad disappointing, but they had some interesting highlights: a homemade washer game in the home goods department and quite an impressive record collection.

And while I felt pretty grumpy about it for awhile, a friend and I discovered this great tea place. And I am so glad I did. There are a lot of reasons why it's a great place.
1. The tea! The selection is huge. There are so many kinds to chose from, non-caffeinated, caffeinated, blends, white, roobios, black, green, chai, fruit and on and on and on. They'll make it hot or cold or even blended up with fruit like a smoothie. 
2. The knowledge. I'm pretty new to the tea scene (coffee-addict, remember?) so I know very little about the different teas, what pairs well together and what kind I like. I asked a ton of questions and the guy ( I think it was the owner, super friendly) answered them all patiently, let me smell the different teas and offered his suggestions. I got an iced Calypso Green Tea with coconut milk and it really surprised me how much I reallllllly liked it. Kudos PuraTea.
3. All their teas (loose-leaf) can be purchased by the ounce and the prices are fantastic!
4. They have alternative milks - I had their coconut milk, no sugar added and I think they have one other choice. They use honey as their sweetener if you want it sweet. 
5. The space. It's nothing special from the outside but the inside is very cozy. Games, books, puzzles and a lot of seating to sit and just hang out. Which is what we did! 

Quiet and real chill place. Can't say enough good things. I'm looking forward to making all the different teas I bought. You can tell they really love tea and have a passion for what they are doing and that sure makes a big difference.",1,iNvbrWOmPrfct3tMzeEdDQ

Bagels (mostly sesame) are served warm from a giant metal sluice that sits next to a table where an aproned man whacks and shapes dough he then shoves, on large trays, into the oven (whence they spill forth via the sluice). There's a refrigerator case stocked with bagel-angled groceries: many varieties of cream cheese, two or three of capers, half a dozen smoked salmon options, and several salmon spreads; a few jams, butter, and some stuff we failed to note. There's another small refrigerator with non-alcoholic drinks. 

The drawback is that the bagels suck. 

""Suck"" is too strong, but we'd been advised that Montréal's bagel scene rivals New York's, and that turns out to be a lunatic's delusion. In flavor, this dough isn't far from a simple street pretzel. What a street pretzel has that these bagels lack, of course, is a thick pelt of salt. Any flavor you get at St. Viateur comes from that refrigerator. The bagels give you a warm smooshy vessel for salmon, cheese, jam, etc., thus fulfilling only the most rudimentary function of a bagel. 

It was late, though; we had played a show and everything else was closed; and so we fell onto the St. Viateur bagels like half-starved hyenas stumbling across an unguarded scrum of newborn kittens (must happen sometimes). Given the strictly-takeout nature of the spot, that meant huddling around a tiny ersatz picnic blanket of paper bags on the sidewalk out front, scooping and spreading cream cheese and sawing salmon with little plastic knives no stiffer than stir sticks. 

There's something attractive about the rudimetary nature of these bagels. Like inchoate little vertebrates crawling out of the sea on their journey to articulated limbs and teeth and wings, St. Viateur's product arouses in the modern mammal an instinctive gratitude. That's not to say, though, we'd ever elect willingly to shed our teeth and thumbs, our poppy seeds and garlic and swirls of pumpernickel.",3,RGydGY3TC2mfqQJOkxkDzw

I stayed at the Tropicana on a quick weekend trip to Vegas for a convention that was next door at the MGM Grand.  The Grand wanted $300 a night thanks to a Def Leppard concert going on that weekend but the dear, sweet Tropicana was selling rooms for a mere $85 a night.  What a deal I thought, only to find out the old adage ""you get what you pay for"" is true.

I wanted to like the Tropicana for pure nostalgia reasons.  The hotel is one of the last Vegas originals still hanging on and was a prime spot back in the Sinatra days so when I got to my room in the Island Tower I tried to close my eyes and pretend like I didn't see the white stains all over the couch and desk chair.  Or the brown stains on the sofa.  Or the bamboo styled bed that had a mirror going up the wall and over the bed.  Truth be told my room had a smell that I couldn't place.  The entire experience was a mysterious adventure with suspect results.

To get to the Island Tower you have to walk down a very long corridor with many vendors selling cheap knock offs of mostly glitter tops and light up buttons, cheap jewelry and hair extensions.  They have a buffet that serves fatty prime rib and french toast; luckily it is all you can eat.

The Tropicana is located at the end of the strip near MGM Grand, New York, New York and Mandalay Bay.  You should stay here for cheap cost and location.  Expect nothing from the casino and hold your nose.",2,cST8Zaw_m73cMYPYA1m1cA

I ordered Mu-shu Shrimp (not on the menu but the chef did it at my request with no issue). Also ordered BBQ Pork appetizer, Crab Rangoons and Pot Stickers.
The Mu-shu Shrimp was very fresh with all the shredded cabbage, mushrooms, etc- stir fried and flavorful. A nice surprise because I haven't had good Chinese food since I moved to AZ in 1998. 
The BBQ Pork was delicious!!! Tender, juicy, sliced and presented so well even in the take out box! Some of the best BBQ pork I've had in years!
Pot Stickers were a little on the blah side, simply for lack of seasoning in the meat filling. If there were more filling that was a bit more seasoned they would be better. I found them to be a bit overdone. 
The Crab Rangoons, big kudos to this restaurant for actually mixing crab in with the cream cheese!!! Now, I don't know if it's real crab or imitation because it was so blended together, but I was impressed. Also, the wonton wrapper used is very thin so these are a bit lighter than the usual Deep fried cheese that most places give us. 
Overall, a very good takeout experience. They make Peking Duck there, so I will be back to dine there and try it. I am a HUGE Peking Duck fan!! 
This place is a nice change from the heavy, greasy, gross Panda Express, Yan's type places that deep fry almost everything as is usual with Americanized Chinese food (that we all know is not real Chinese food)... There are no crab Rangoons in chinese restaurants in china. Duh. I think people will enjoy this better (while not authentic) option on the west side.",0,2jIBLVSX3L89nsOQ_qojGw

I found on arriving at the terminal there was little signage or instruction on what I should do so I waited in line to see an employee. In the end she told me because I had booked and printed online I didn't need to do anything so to just take my bag outside and wait. The seat was comfortable enough. There was wifi and an electrical outlet. Boarding is a cluster-. There aren't really signs to tell you where to be and people kind of spill out of lines into areas the busses have to pull into. The only major annoyance was that the trip took an extra two hours each way due to boarder delays but that's not the bus line's fault. All in all, I'd do it again.

We were pleasantly surprised at what was behind the shiny exterior of this hidden treasure in Cleveland Heights. In fact, I would say that we were elated upon finding this place.

I would surmise there are perhaps two different experiences in this restaurant with regard to atmosphere and service as well as time of day visited. I am surprised the overall rating for this place isn't higher. 

First off, the bartenders here are superior in their creations of cocktails.They are masters of mixology and to watch them create is a pleasure itself.  The offerings are quite exquisite. I am so happy they have absinthe and chartreuse!  The GINNTANG drink is beautiful and sooooo delicious! The menu lists a pitcher of ABSINTHE if you are daring enough to order such an extravagance. This is on my list of future ""to do's"" as I look forward to a night of hallucinations and bizarre dreaming (if you have ever had absinthe, you will know what I mean)!!!
 
The food is very good!  Everything we have tried so far has been perfect. The Katz Club sandwich was beautifully presented and oh so tasty! The Vegan Curried Lentil Soup is unique in flavor.  The Spinach and Frisee salad was also very good and has fresh, crisp ingredients. Add the chicken to the salad and it will deliver a smooth, smoky overall flavor to the dish. We even had room for a piece of their birthday cake which was ""melt in your mouth"" texture and deliciously sweet in the right way. 

The bar car has such a cool vibe and the lighting gives it such a sexy ambiance. They had soft R&B playing in the background which we love so much. I truly feel happy and relaxed when I am sitting in this hideaway. I have to say that I find this place to be one of my absolute favorites in the area. 

I highly recommend the Katz Club Diner to anyone who is looking for a relaxed, slower paced evening where you want to enjoy a special libation and delicious food in a ""speak easy"" environment.",1,1zC9x8mAEGh3YfBljBBqyw

DOWNSIDE:
This place has TV playing.  College boys with hot girlfriends sitting at cocktail tables with their heads cocked to the side watching lame TV shows.  They have dialog TV, not music videos.  It felt kinda like having beers with friends at a chess tournament instead of a bar...I asked the bartender if they could put some music on.  He said, ""Yes,"" but 15 minutes later there still wasn't any.  

So I brought my guitar in and started a sing-along with my group of friends who were with me.  Several people throughout the bar came over and started singing with us.  Someone even bought my 3 beers before my tab came.  It seems management doesn't understand that part of a Friday night bar scene, is music.  

I advise to drop the dry dialog non-funny TV shows.  Unless perhaps no music is their bar niche.  I guess there are those who don't like music.  Of course singing our own songs for 45 minutes at the top of our lungs was a blast for my group. Not sure how they felt about it, but they didn't kick us out.",0,yAdnKwB8ReKDY-0po46Thw

For the appetizer, we shared the Shredded Pork with Skin Spring Rolls.  I had the small combo pho ($8,50). Broth was very falvorful and natural (no MSG that I could detect). I did tell Ken that our other favorite Viet place, Pho Saigon 8, small portion had a little more noodles which would probably cost them less than a quarter, but will increase the ""perceived value.""

So, just like the name states, you have 9 rounds to complete in 30 minutes.  Each round is 3 minutes and there is a 30 second ""active rest"" inbetween rounds.  Each round combines cardio, core and strength so you are ensured a total body workout.  This is somewhat of a ""kickboxing fusion"" concept so at a few of the rounds you put your boxing gloves on and go to town on a punching bag!  It is actually quite refreshing and a great way to release tension after a long day at work!  

The stations change every day so you are constantly ""tricking"" your body which is a great way to see results.  You will  see a variety of moves like jump roping, squats, burpees, planks, roundhouse kicks, various punches, pushups, dips, etc

This is a great place for all fitness levels.  The trainers challenge you along the way or they can modify if you have any injuries.  Everyone is super nice, the music is fun and the workout is awesome!!  Give them a try!

Our first complaint was that there was absolutely no one at the counter along with no sign posted when they would be back. So after 30 aggravating minutes, the representative decided to do her job and return to work. She was not very friendly and was very short with us. She did not explain many options that we could add on for the car. After all this, she informed us ""we were receiving a free upgrade"". When we walked to our car, we walked to a Nissan Versa. This was no upgrade. On top of the lies we were told, the car was not filled with gas. We took the car anyway and headed to San Diego. We woke up the next morning (New Years Day) and had planned to see a few sights before the car needed to be returned at our hotel in La Jolla. We went to the counter to confirm our time of return (which is suppose to be 30 minutes after the rental began in the first place). Well, the rep here tells us she is only open until noon and the car must be back by this time. There was absolutely NO notice of this at all and we were NEVER informed that Avis would be closing early. The rep was pretty rude and definitely showed she did not care much about our situation. After this, she went out to check the car. When she came back, she tried to charge our rental with gas money because the tank was 3/4 full (which was more full than the 1/2 tank we got when we picked up the car). She argued with me for about five minutes and I refused to pay any extra money, especially because we were returning at 9 am instead of the 4 pm we were expecting. Any way, we ended up taking a cab to what we had planned which was $100 total. I called Avis' costumer service number and they showed absolutely no interest in my complaint. I have rented from Hertz before and I know this would NEVER happen. Avoid Avis at all costs. They don't try harder.",1,jpPJwI_QV50-eMWcFnoDVw

I paid a 200$ start up fee and now 33$ per month. My sales rep. was sociable and professional and I was comfortable with the arranged payment plan. But what does that money get me?

The gym is less then a year old so the equipment and building are new and clean. With the appalling exception of the showers. There seems to always be at least two that are out-of-order, and the grime on them makes no sense what so ever for the time they have been in use.

Condos have created an arms race in the form of amenities they offer their residences. With increased competition fitness centers have begun a similar war to draw clients. Below are the amenities the Markham LA fitness offers and does not offer.

Offers

Basket Ball court- Not a full court size and always packed

Spin room - Lots of nice new bikes

Personal Training - I have only been bothered once about doing a fitness assessment 

Pool - much like the basket ball court, it is available but more so just to say they have one. Its barely bigger then a waiting pool

Yoga/ fitness class - Have not attended myself but I see them going on regularly 

juice bar - over priced

kids center - if I were a parent I would be appreciative 

Does not offer

Squash courts - squash is available at some LA fitness but only with a premium membership usually 5$ extra pre month

olympic lifting platform, running track, towels

If they fire whoever is the maintenance manager and get the cleanliness of the washrooms up to par I would raise this review to a respectable 3 star. LA has some work to do over all if they want to compete with Goodlife and the YMCA.",2,jNuaw_2e5DYKPx-MRdUEOg

It came with two whole wheat pitas placed under the fish, three whole deep fried pitas, three sides of hummus, and four lemons sliced into halves. I also got 1lb of cold, roasted veggies (zucchini, assorted bell peppers, and eggplant). 

The fish platters cost me just under $20 before tax and the veggies cost me $4 before tax. This was dinner for my parents and me, and we had a whole mackerel, two whiting, assorted pitas, hummus, lemons, and veggies left over. For a dinner that came to about $8/person before tax, that was a lot of food. 

It was also done really well. The mackerel was super juicy and the whiting heads were crispy enough that I basically just ate the entire head without spitting out anything but the eyeballs. Yeah, I'm that kind of person. 

Oh. I also got a mango juice from the drink section right across from the prepared food section. It was $0.99 and tasted like mangoes. I also got a basil seed drink that was quite pink. Rose flavored, supposedly. It tasted exactly the way Vitamin E Body Butter from the Body Shop smells, and has almost an aloe vera juice texture. I quite enjoyed it. It was also $0.99.

For dessert, I picked up a creme brulee for $3.49. My mom has a thing for creme brulee, but it is not cheap, so when I saw this one, I had to get it. It came in a ceramic dish the size of a CD. The ceramic dish was included in that price. The creme brulee custard was super creamy. It also was not too sweet. The sugar crust could have been crispier, but I understand that because it was not made fresh, it is hard to expect much more than what I got. This was a great deal though! I most certainly will get this again.

Coming from Finch station, take the subway to Bloor Yonge and transfer to the eastbound train to Broadview then take the 504 street car southbound to Queen East and it's about a 5 mins walk from there. 

I went here to see Alvvays for their biggest headlining show in Toronto, a Sold-Out crowd at Opera House. 

The venue is pretty small, and it has a really sketchy grill/restaurant attached if you wanted to get some food before the show. I didn't eat there but the food didn't look too bad.
 
The inside was very clean, and they have multiple bars. 2 on the General Admission floors and one on the balcony. 

The sound was nice, and there were great acoustics. The sightline were also very nice, and you could get a good view of the stage from pretty much anywhere in the venue. 

I sat up in the balcony and had a GREAT view of the stage. The bar was very close to my balcony seat and I had no problem getting a drink. They have a decent selection of beers.

The drinks, like any venue are over priced, I paid $7.25 for a tallboy of PBR.

The washrooms were also well maintained and were located downstairs. They had an attendant which I have NEVER seen. Don't really know why he's there.

Opera House is a great Toronto venue that books some pretty great up and coming bands. It's not the easiest place to get to but not that hard either. 

I would definitely come back if they booked another band I wanted to see.",5,TVAFBcSuqJ3d1fRYHKgjiA

They have multiple doctors who work at this location but I see Dr. Mark Schubert. I hardly ever meet with the doctor even though I am in the office once or twice a week to receive the injections administered by a nurse.

They seem to be helping with my symptoms but beware - at the beginning of this process I was told that I would receive an injection weekly for about a year. After about a year and a half I asked if there was anyway to speed up the process because it was inconvenient going every week and they said that they could split the allergens in to two separate  so that the dosage could be higher. I don't know why this wasn't offered to me as an option at the beginning of my treatment. So since January of this year I have been received two shots, one in each arm, every Tuesday and Friday. Recently, I questioned them about the process again and they said it takes about 3-5 years of weekly injections to build up a good immunity before you can go down to an injection every other week, etc. They said they have patients who have been receiving injections for 20 years!

You have to dedicate about an hour for this process too. When you get there you sign in, wait to have your name called, receive the injection, then have to wait a half hour at the office to make sure you don't have a bad reaction.

I kind of feel like I'm getting scammed since they can bill insurance and/or get a co-pay for every office visit but I still have to get the injections since my allergies are so severe. Know what you're getting yourself in to if you start this regimen and commit to it.",4,-sFdV5hTNg8Qx-sbqAB2yg

If you're looking for a expansive, over-the-top spa, complete with 4 dipping pools, 3 jacuzzis, 2 saunas, and an acre locker room, this isn't the place for you. But if you're looking for a low-key spa with friendly attendants, clean facilities, and a great deal then you should check this out this place.

Facilties: a smallish locker room, 2 showers, 2 full-bathrooms with vanity area, a steamroom, and waiting room. With any treatment of 1 hour or more, you get full access to the fitness room. Complimentary shampoo, conditioner, facewash, lotions are available in the locker room, along with disposable brushes, combs, and razors. While you wait, enjoy some lemon water or Forte tea.

Services: Massages, body treatments, and facials. I opted for the 90-minute Lomi Lomi which included a body scrub and massage.

Value: Comparable to other spas in the Valley. However, they currently have a coupon on their website that gives you $25 off any 60- or 90-minute treatment. They also accept Spa Finder certificates ($100 certificates available at Costco for $80). Combine these things and you can enjoy the 90-minutes of heaven for $160, (20% tip included).

Well, the GTA.

The Montreal Deli is just west of the 427 and has plenty of parking. That I'm leading with it being conveniently located just beyond an overpass and raving about the parking might not bode well. But it's not that bad.

Smoked meat in Toronto (or Mississauga) is what it is. Depending on your Clintonian definition of what ""is"" is, Montreal Deli is doing its best. Prices are reasonable. The super smoked meat plate (about $11.50) gives you a nice stack of meat, fully acceptable fries, slaw, and a kosher dill. If you think of this as anything *but* a simulacrum of the true Montreal smoked meat experience, well, it's pretty awesome all around.

For purists, I've included in the photo section a photo of the Montreal deli smoked meat super combo and the gold standard of smoked meat, Schwartz's. A keen observer will note the difference in consistency of the meat. The Montreal Deli serves it up almost like a thinly sliced ham. Schwartz's gives you thick rich slices of smoked meat ready to crumble and then melt in your mouth. [Oh god, 2.5 hours until lunch time. - your stomach butting in]

Susan C's better half quibbled with the bread and I defer to his judgment there. I was a suburban boy (a shout out to my homies in Dollard-des-Ormeaux!) Susan's better half is a McGill grad, hence a veteran of smoked meat and it probably goes without saying the Peel pub. From his lack of joyous weeping, I gather he was in the same opinion boat as I.

I'll say this, however, service is fast. I think we had our food in about five minutes. I've waited longer at McDonald's for a McFlurry. 

Bottom line: prices are great, service is fast and great, you get a lot of great food, it's still not real Montreal smoked meat, but give it a try.

(Those without access to a crap car, you can subway it to Kipling, I think jump on the West Mall bus, and then get off before it diverges off Dundas. It's not an unpleasant walk to the Montreal Deli.)",10,mb_8jXannipO5T5V5kGXiQ

I've been wanting to stop in here for awhile, and too be honest, I've mostly wanted to stop in the morning or afternoon for a coffee and/or food (and I'll be doing that at some point!), but the opportunity presented itself randomly on a Friday night so I stopped in for a couple beers.

I loved the atmosphere. There's lots of space (both indoors & a patio), with comfortable chairs and couches. The staff is extremely friendly & outgoing. Since it was near the end of the night there were only a couple people working, but the guy working behind the bar (I believe his name was Alex...for as much as we talked to him I really should remember) was very outgoing. He seemed to know a lot about both the beers on tap & bottled beers & made my friend I was w/his own whiskey concoction, which she really liked. Speaking of whiskey, I was actually surprised this place even served liquor (I believe they only have whiskey). I just assumed they were beer & wine, but apparently they're not. 

Like I said, I really need to try some other things here to get more of a feel for this place, but I really liked what I saw & tasted in the short amount of time I stopped in for. 

One last thing I should point out that I really like about this place is the hours. I actually LIKE that they close early (compared to bars).

So not only did your employee not honor the posted hours as I outlined in the review, but when this was brought to your attention, you now have passive aggressively resorted to saying I am confusing you with another business. I guess if this was my business, I would also want to deflect the negative yet truthful review! Good luck with that tactic of insinuating your potential customers are senile and demented. I see another poster stated he pulled up during operating hours and had a similar experience but was given a chance to have the test done, granted for ""cash"" since the machine was down before closing time had occurred. Guess people are just pulling these occurrences out of the sky...

No one wants their time wasted. That's why We decided to post the review. I get it. The employee was an older man who wanted to skip out early. Fine.

The European cheese shop is probably one of my favorite places at the market; they have a great selection; I always find myself sampling several different cheeses before deciding on two to three to get.  I also really like Theresa's Bakery, Ohio City Pasta, and several of the meat vendors, one of whom makes a great variety of different sausages.

There's always a great atmosphere at West Side Market, too. (Although, I'll admit, I typically go on days one would expect it to be crowded, like the day before Thanksgiving.)  When I'm there, the place is abuzz with activity.

instead of the usual ""order from the menu"" deal, it literally is a buffet where all the meats, sides, and other dishes like sushi and soup are at a buffet bar. load your plates with your party so you can go back to your table and cook everything family style.

kalbi, bulgogi, spicy pork belly, riblets, brisket. it's all good. the only thing missing is the steamed egg platter more famous at some of the kbbq places i've been to here in so cal. all in all, a great place to enjoy some great food when you're in a good sized party.

Overall, the problem was with the process.  I liked my salesperson.  Everyone was friendly enough and I have at least some hopes for the service department; however, for a luxury car dealership, the process lacked luxury for sure.  

I went on a whim on a Saturday and test drove one vehicle.  That went fine and was reasonably efficient.  I then wanted to see a more upgraded model before deciding.  That took over an hour, since as a city dealership, they have to go get the car.  The car ran out of gas on the way, so there was that delay as well.  I looked and left, asking the salesperson to provide pricing via e-mail because I was out of time by the time they got the car there.   

There were some wires crossed in the communication, but we eventually all got on the same page and I made an appointment at 9am the following Saturday to show them my trade and complete a cash purchase.  I had already shown my tendency toward impatience on the previous visit.  And I very clearly stated that I didn't want to be there all morning when I made the appointment, so I was hoping that they'd have everything ready except for my trade value.  Not so much.  

The trade evaluation was quick, but then the inefficiency really started.  They didn't have the pricing ready, so there was a wait there.  Then the finance guy was needed (no loan, but he also does title work and the warranty sales spiel ).  He had not a thing prepared either, so I had to wait for him.  Then to the cashier, who had to call and verify my check and issue a receipt - more waiting.  The tech guy who explained all the buttons was next - had to wait for him too.  His spiel needed a little work, but it was good enough.  Then the car needed gassed - again, another wait. 

All told, an efficient process could have easily taken under an hour.  This took over two and a half and that was with me quite impatiently skipping pieces and trying to push it along.  The problem is that their whole process is linear - you are passed from one person to the next with a lot of waiting in between.  Why they can't gas up the car while I am doing the paperwork is beyond me.  Why the tech guy couldn't have done his thing in the 45 minutes I spent waiting for the finance guy is also beyond me.  Why the cashier couldn't have worked on my check while I was doing title work...you get the idea.   

I am sure that people generally spend a ton more time buying a car and perhaps that is normal, but I made an appointment specifically to avoid all of that.  If they are truly serving the luxury market, they need to coordinate the buying process better.",6,h9LPugJk2cpIh0gmQb5LnQ

It was odd to me that I needed to pay up front, but they wouldn't give it to me without payment. So, I paid. I have two insurances--one did not pay, but the other paid quite a bit. I was told that if insurance covered, they'd put a check in the mail right away. Those were their words. I've seen nothing. I've yet to go in to try to get my money. I'll update when I do. 

The next issue was that my daughter supposedly needed four crowns. She'd been at a pediatric dentist. But she is 17 and he noticed she had one problem area that look like a possible crown and her pediatric dentist felt she was ready to go to a regular dentist. He said her teeth looked great except for that one spot. So, we go to Providence Dental where they tell us she needs at least four crowns and possibly root canals. I tell the dentist that her pediatric dentist didn't say she needed all of that. His response? ""That's why you need to take kids to a real dentist. I wouldn't take my own kids to a pediatric dentist past the age of seven."" So--a pediatric dentist isn't a real dentist? 

When we walked in for one of my daughter's appointments, the gal at the front desk tells me my amount after insurance. It was really high. I was confused but almost paid it, but then I stopped and said, ""Is that with both of our insurances?"" She says, ""Yes, but since you're getting x type (can't remember what it is called) of crowns, your insurance won't cover it."" So, I asked what type of crowns those are. She explains they're a special kind of crown but covered by a warranty, blah blah blah. I tell her no one mentioned those to me before this. Are they mandatory? She says, no they're optional. So, they were trying to upsell me these special crowns without even telling me anything about them before hand. She tells me that they're really great and under warranty so if anything happens they can be fixed or replaced. I tell her I had a crown that fell out once and my insurance fixed it--so why would I pay for an expensive crown that insurance won't cover if I can pay for a normal crown that insurance will cover. She just looked at me. She had no answer. It was ridiculous. 

After that visit, I decided we weren't going back. I started hunting for a new dentist. My husband still planned to continue going to Providence Dental. He had an appointment in December but had to reschedule due to his crazy work schedule. So, he switched it to February. In February, he had to reschedule again. This time he told the lady he just wanted to cancel and would reschedule when things calmed down at work. She was extremely rude to him. She kept pressing him to just reschedule and if he couldn't make it, he could reschedule again. He insisted that he had no idea when to make the appointment because of work and would just feel better making the appointment when he had a better idea of an opening in his schedule. She kept sighing heavily and being snippy with him. So, he's decided he's done there too. 

Two of my kids are still at their pediatric dentist. We've been with that dentist for over a decade. We've never had an issue with the staff, with the dentist or with billing. I wish we could all just see that dentist. Finding a good dentist who isn't just out for the money is really difficult.",4,abwO4VF4JcVYQ7CURAwsyw

Ok fine, though the rest of my party was almost finished eating their meals. By the time she brought out my new rack, I could already tell something was wrong. I cut into it and not surprised, it was completely raw. When the waitress came back to check on me I showed her the raw meat and she seemed confused and said that yes, I had ordered medium rare. Um, no. The manager came over and offered to have the chef cook it again. By that time everyone was done with their meals so I declined and said I didn't want it anymore. We got 'free' dessert but was annoyed that the manager didn't do more to make it right. No voucher nor discount off our $521 bill. Very disappointed and will not be back again.

I'm a very small person so obviously if it's half the size of my palm I don't even think this constitutes as acceptable on a sandwich. The flavors were good but it was disappointing because of the proportion of bread to meat. I will say,however, that the homemade chips were AMAZING and probably honestly the best I have ever had-and I am NOT a chip person at all!

We began with a delicious beet salad that included both cabbage and seasoned carrots followed shortly by varenki, Russian style dumplings generously filled with melt-in-your mouth potatoes and sour cream.  For an entree my wife ordered schnitzel, an Israeli style chicken fillet that had been rolled in panko and fried, adding a small house salad at a nominal cost. I chose beef stroganoff served in a cream and mushroom sauce.  Both entrees included a good sized portion of roasted young potatoes that were delicious.

I will say that Frank Marino is really engaging and hilarious.  Just a side note, he talks in rapid fire, stand-up style and throws a lot of show biz references and jokes that some generations/foreigners may not get.  So brush up on your current events and pop stars!  

There are a lot of drag performers performing as stars like: Beyonce, Madonna, Shania Twain, Mariah, Janet Jackson...Cher was prob my personal fav, but all the acts were great.  It is nice that you can sing along and that the audience is so carefree and chill.  There were people of all ages there and the place is so small that you really don't get a bad seat.  I recommend the middle though and not the left and right sides. My upgrade tickets were $20 and drinks were under $10, so this is totally affordable for a show on the strip.

Not rude, but just not friendly.  We had breakfast at Mr. Lucky's, then hit the pool.  We went to the Rehab pool first, where we would've had to purchase $100 in food and drinks each to use a lounge chair.

So I got a new car from this dealership Kia Optima S 2018 (224/227) test driven miles on April 7, 2018. We negotiated a price of approximately 23k for the vehicle and I was very firm on my monthly payments and what I expected to pay the sales person Ian he didn't tell me that it wasn't a firm final offer. So I sign everything and get everything settled and stuff I get called on (04/12/2018) being told the bank won't approve for the length of my term but that I got a lower interest rate and better offer. So this is from TJ finance manager, I get in and guess what? Not the finance manager nor the sales person who sold me the car would speak to me, Chris a person I've never met, tries to negotiate with me and tells me the price is gonna be well over $400 a month I told them this isn't what I negotiated and looking at the total price for 72 months the car comes out to over 30k... that's almost 10k more, how are they going to charge me that much? They didn't even bother explaining anything to me, so I said no, what are my options? he didn't give me any, so I said I had no problem returning the car and going to Honda. Chris says honda won't get me a good deal and they are the worst and I said the worst that can happen is being lied to and you guys did that. So I did what any reasonable person would do... I took my stuff from the car and gave them the keys, and left to Honda. So today, I go and ask for my downpayment check which isn't cut, and Chris had told me he would have it cut, and he says the finance team wasn't there supposedly and they can't cut my check, they want to mail it and I clearly say NO, I need my money. He said Monday the earliest. This the 4th lie from Kia. So now they are giving me the run around. Seriously, stay away from this dealership. Check out the reviews from BBB and online these aren't lies. They are scammers and try to add hidden fees. So if it's possible look elsewhere. Returning the vehicle was the best decision I made in my life. Go to Honda or any dealership, they have Kia's there. If anyone is doubting this I kept copies of everything and I do hope this review helps others to realize that the car they have they can return if you're bullied into a deal you know that you can't afford, you have time to return it, read the fine detail it's there. Please be aware and know it's possible. Take YOUR hard earned money and time elsewhere where they will value you, clearly Kia doesn't. I will be filing a complaint with BBB and the company and leaving reviews on all social platforms.

We were very pleased with Burgr at the Planet Hollywood and figured we would be equally pleased here.  Overall we really wanted to like the place but were disappointed and will not return, especially after the surreal experience towards the end of our stay.

We didn't have to wait to long to get in (30 minutes and my wife won some decent coin on the slots beforehand).  Our server was not very knowledgeable about the beer selection or other items on the menu (as we were about to find out).  My wife wanted to get a beer comparable to Stella Artois (something we could justify spending $10 on) but the server could not help us identify a similar beer since we were unfamiliar with some of the brands and figured he was.  We ended up ordering sodas and water instead.  Probably a wise choice considering the cost.

I ordered the bangers and mash and my wife ordered the onion soup and the mac and cheese.  I enjoyed the sausage links (made in-house) but felt the potatoes were a bit overdone with cream and butter.  My wife liked the onion soup but felt that there was only one tiny slice of french bread on the top and not the normal amount of bread usually served with this soup.  The taste of the mac and cheese was pretty good yet the noodles were very underdone.  They were about 3-4 minutes away from being al dente.  When my wife brought this up to our server (she has professional kitchen and culinary training), he said ""yes, the noodles are supposed to be al dente"", and that was it.  It was a weird exchange.  It was too bad the noodles were too gummy because the rest of it was pretty tasty.

I had never had rhubarb before, so my wife ordered the rhubarb cobbler from the menu.  After about 15 minutes, our server came to us and said the item had been 86'd from the menu but they were making some more ""downstairs"".  My wife (a former employee of Caesars/Harrahs) asked about the other desserts and found that they come from the downstairs bakery that provides pastries for other eateries in the casino.  We were very disappointed with this news.  The desserts might be Ramsay's recipes or they might not be (it wasn't clear to us), but the fact that they were being mass-produced in the downstairs bakery rather than in-house upset us a little.  Nothing against the people who work in the bakery at Caesar's (they make some delicious pastry), but for a fine dining experience you would expect to get your dessert made in house at the prices being charged.  After 15 more minutes they delivered the cobbler, yet the cobbler they delivered was a peach cobbler.  She again notified our server, and this is where it got bizarre.  He argued that it was indeed rhubarb (a different kind of rhubarb at that) mixed with other fruits.  My wife was flabbergasted, as was I.  She knows the difference between a rhubarb and a peach and was offended that our server tried to convince us otherwise.  I have no experience with rhubarb myself, yet I know it is reddish-purple because I see it at the store.  I also know what a peach looks like, and it looked and tasted exactly like the fruit that was in the cobbler.  There wasn't a shred of red or purple anywhere in that cobbler, just straight up yellow.  After we left, I looked up a picture of rhubarb cobbler and it was bright red and purple.  We sent the cobbler back and they did not charge us for it.  Afterwards the manager came to us and apologized for the mix-up, yet still carried the viewpoint that it was a different kind of rhubarb.

This is one of the older GoodLife clubs but it was renovated several years ago (I can't remember the exact time frame as I was a member of Bally Fitness back then) but I want to say 2004-2005.

The club is located on the second level offices opposite the theatres and the layout is a bit odd as it seems like everything was shoe horned to fit some leftover space.  This location has a swimming pool though many may challenge that definition and call it an oversized bathtub.  It is unique for any gym in the downtown to offer a pool and it uses salt water.

The facility is small and there is minimal equipment so expect to share often working in while you're resting between sets.  You need to pass through an open concept spinning room to get to a weights area and the aerobics room in the far back of the gym.  The older gym had old carpeting and the update has certainly helped.  I use this club when i'm in the area so it's my second most used gym outside of my home club.

The trainers and members seem pretty nice here bit I'm not familiar with any of the instructors in these classes.  Despite it's small size, it has enough equipment to get a short workout in without any major issues.The space is tight between the equipment and some of them are older.  Will not accommodate many members and has shorter hours than most other GoodLife clubs.  Overall, I'll rate it as a 3 star facility.",5,mtC7hy-bMp17ZT5Zebo2xw

After a long boycott of this establishment by myself because of how they handled their grand opening food giveaway, I finally decided, WTH let's give them a shot. Unfortunately, I should have held tight with the boycott. I walk in at lunchtime and there is just one table with any patrons at it, and they were served right after I ordered, so I figured my wait shouldn't be long. Wrong... apparently it's takes way more time than I realized to cook a burger that is the size of a quarter. And even though they are tiny little pucks of meat, they are priced like a regular sized burger. And none of that would have drawn my ire had they simply made my one teeny, tiny burger as I had ask them to, which they did not. Not even close. And when I called to let them know how they goofed, I didn't receive an apology, but rather was told to come back for the correct burger. Yeah, I'll pass on that.

The atmosphere is sort of fun-loving with a cute minibar at the front of the restaurant and seating arrangements spanning from patio, main floor and second floor. 

The service is almost non-existant...You have a server appear once and then never again. You are perched or famished or something but no one is in sight...You can hear staff laughter or see them sipping on a beverage while you try to control your own thirst for water or coffee or tea. If you have a table to wait on, why are you not doing so? Of course, I am not suggesting to constantly be on the lookout for what to do for your customers but some semblance of thoughtfulness of bringing over the menu or a glass of water really goes a long way!

The food is inedible. My go to was always the Blueberry Hill. However...Once it was slightly burned which I excused and simply ate. The second time was completely burned. Each pancake was covered in burnt pieces of dough...There was an attempt to conceal it with more blueberry compote but failed miserably. I had asked to replace it and was denied. This ties back to the notion that customers are not the priority here but rather maintaining a relaxed attitude is. Again all we diners ask is that our food is cooked well (or even decently or maybe even considered edible) because we pay for your services and your food. You hurt your customer's trust in your product by displaying certain things and frankly, this is not my recommended anything anymore.",1,D4fp_dBszPtWwpfUcRuvbQ

Okay, perhaps not a virgin per say, but a novice, a newbie, perhaps a beginner wanting to migrate to intermediate. Primers, different brushes for different areas, strobe, pinch pots, bb creme vs foundation, wth? 
I'm pretty simple with the whole make up game, but do occasionally fantasize that I could put on make up and not look a french prostitute, and even though the talented make up artists at Mac know a thing or two about beautifying oneself through make up application, I often don't love the finished look of my painted up face. I must say though this last time, Christina was very skilled in the whole make up process. 
Having brought a friend in who is newly divorced and even less adept in make up than myself, I was so excited to see her all gussied up, fake lashes and all. 
I purchased a few items, will try them out, and as they say, practice makes perfect. 
Mac is a little pricey, but I do think some of their products are worth it. I have read they don't test on animals anymore, which is a good thing, I try to only buy products from companies that don't. Testing on furry friends is not cool.

The waitress arrived with 2 egg rolls but we told her not to bother to go back to the kitchen for the remaining order.  Glad we did because the egg rolls tasted stale as though they sat around for a week and were reheated for serving.  The dipping sauce was a spicy chili sauce and it was terrific, especially in offsetting the stale flavor of the egg rolls.  The main course of honey chicken itself was tender and had no grizzle.  However the dish lacked any flavor whatsoever.  There was a sparing amount of glaze on the plate which accompanied the chicken but it too didn't add much taste to the dish.  I wouldn't order the egg rolls and the honey chicken again.  The big surprise was the brown rice.  It was awesome.  It was tender and cooked to perfection.

Mixed emotions on this one. Came hoping to love, left a little disappointed.

ME: Linguine w/ triple cream brie w/ toasted walnuts, mushrooms, prosciutto, fresh herbs & Parmesan. Added chicken for $3 more, per waiter's suggestion. There was brie, even some chunks, but it wasn't very strong, in aroma or flavor. (When I drank a sip of Point Noir with a bite, that seemed to bring out the brie.) There were absolutely no mushrooms, which were greatly missed in this dish. And there was hardly any prosciutto, again, missed. Basically I ended up with walnuts & chicken in linguine in a creamy cheese sauce. And I didn't need the chicken after all, I think the dish would've been better without it. Overall, an OK dish, but not as interesting since it didn't follow the menu description. (FOLLOWUP: I had some left over the next day, and it actually improved in brie flavor having set overnight in the fridge.)

SPOUSE: Filet Oscar, which was  the classic filet of beef topped w/ king crab and Bearnaise sauce, w/ asparagus, then drizzled w/ Cabernet sauce, all on top of leek mashed potatoes. OK, there was a POOL of Cabernet sauce, and hardly any Bearnaise. The beef was good, for a filet, and exactly as ordered, rare. But for the money spent, spouse wasn't thrilled. Good, not great. His meal did come with choice of a salad or soup, he chose butternut squash soup, which was good, tasted more like pumpkin, earthy & sweet.

DESSERT: We split the pear dessert, which was again good, not great. We also split a glass of Chilean dessert sauvignon blanc, which the waiter brought in separate glasses, a nice touch. The wine was recommendable: fruity, aromatic, not too sweet.

WINES: All we drank were wines-by-the-glass. It was nice to find a Patricia Green Pinot Noir on a by-the-glass list. The cheaper-line-by-Schraumsberg Mirabelle sparkling rose was better than I had expected. (LONG time ago, I had tried Mirabelle Brut and thought it smelled/tasted like bug spray! Obviously Schramsberg has improved the wines on their secondary program!) And the nebbiolo was fine. But the bill for 4 glasses of wine skyrocketed the cost of our experience.

SERVICE/VENUE: Attentive, nice waiter. Nice setting. (We had to sit outside, cuz it was crazy full inside, but the heater sufficed for the outdoors at night.)

OVERALL: If we had not had our $50 Groupon with us, we would've paid $170+ for this meal, which I found rather crazy. I'm glad I finally tried Grape Street, but I won't go outta my way to return.

PS: I wish we could have tried the food at Nora's Wine Bar, which closed recently. The only day we visited, we only got to do wines. THAT menu looked incredible, authentic Italy Italian, AND they had a fantastic selection of wines by the glass as well. Sigh.",1,_ReALUaGu7Qayk4ULX9wnQ

Sloppiness in the kitchen prevented this from being a better review than it is, but if the kitchen can make mistakes like these, I have serious questions about how good they are.

We all had salads for our first course:
 - The Caesar was enough for two, but the dressing was boring to say the least.  No brightness of any sort.
 - The baby beets were good, though again the dressing was much understated - that is to say, mostly olive oil.
 - The arugula was fine, but again nothing special.
 - The roasted red peppers were fine, though oily.

As for mains:
 - The New York strip was cooked perfectly, but was served a little above room temperature.  I would have sent it back, but figured that if I did so, I'd be getting my steak while everyone else was having dessert.
 - The filet we had at the table was excellent.  However, the portion was huge.
 - The flat iron steak was a bit small and not cooked medium well as requested, but the taste was excellent.
 - The grilled salmon was cooked properly and was deemed to be wonderful.

Sides:
 - Asparagus - grilled to death and greasy  - uck!
 - Brussels Sprouts - what can you say about food cooked with bacon - yummy - if not a bit greasy.  (We ate all of them.)
 - Potatoes - we ordered Fingerlings but got whipped Yukon Gold.  (We didn't request a change since it was not worth worrying about.)  The whipped potatoes had enough butter and cream in them to clog the arteries of the people at the table next to ours.  Consistency was a bit too much like baby food for us, but they were very good.

Desserts:
 - Ice cream - not much to say about that
 - Monkey bread - very good, but very rich
 - Banana brioche bread pudding - okay - I'm still waiting for the taste of the banana.

For the price of the meal, the portions were very generous.  All of the sides were big enough for generous helpings for two or three people.  However, the fact that the kitchen sent out a cold steak and grossly overcooked asparagus gives me more than ample cause for concern.

All of the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.

All-in-all, a very good value for the money, but the kitchen needs to clean up their act.  I would give them a second chance, but having been to other steak houses in Vegas, it would be a hard sell, since we know of better choices with more professional kitchens and exceptional service.",1,Bjz4TBIlyv6SBvYf5IOHBA

This was my third time here.  I was exhausted by about Floor 3.  There are some cool displays and some interesting information, but I don't think I would have been too thrilled to have paid full price.  The best part is the Induction section.  Huge screens with videos highlighting inductions over the years.  It is long.  But you get to sit down.  After walking around the museum for about three hours, it felt good to do so.  Parking is $8 in the lot to the east of the museum, close to the lake.  It was the cheapest lot we found.  The thing that bothers me about this museum is the music competing with other music.  For example, the Beatles section is close to the Rolling Stones section, but you can't really appreciate the background music playing for either one, since you hear pieces of ""Love Me Do"" when you are trying to appreciate ""Satisfaction"".  The costumes on display are another great section of the museum.  I loved that part.  It gets a little crowded on the weekends, so try to go during the week if you can.

Interesting that I asked the staff for recommendations but they just directed me towards the menu....haha

The bingsu was definitely my favourite among the two. The mango was diced into small pieces that made it easy to enjoy with the shaved ice. Did not have as much of the chocolate waterfall, but the toast was nice and crunchy. The menu is a bit small but they have all the common bingsu options (e.g. matcha, mango, strawberry, five cereal) and similar flavors for their ""waterfall"".

My latest experience here was on Tuesday for the Holiday Buffet which cost roughly $30/person for lunch and the best dish they had there was cocktail shrimp (I believe that says a lot regarding the quality of this establishment). There was a salad bar with not only salad but quinoa (pretty good) and veggies. They also offered salmon which was cold, tasteless, dry, as well as pork, steak, turkey which happen to all be tasteless and chewy. Dessert bar was cookies that looked like they were from Costco (which might be better since they're chewy), some tarts and a holiday dessert. 

They opened the window to the room which held all the food and it was pretty chilly on Tuesday so obviously there will be a draft which will cause the food to be cold even if you place it under a heat lamp/warming tray - go figure.

Service here is meh. It's like the judge you whether or not you have an actual membership or a guest pass (which we had). I enjoy the dinning rooms as they are very Victorian-esque atmosphere.

DRINKS:
Sauvignon Blanc, Eradus (for me) - more on the sweeter end, which I preferred. 
Pinot Grigio, Serenissima (bf)

APPETIZERS:
PAN SEARED SCALLOPS (3/5)
(Seasoned with curry salt, green apple purée)
The scallops were seared perfectly - very delicious. Unfortunately, I didn't think the green apple purée was a good match with the scallops.l, it was too sour. 3 points goes to the scallops though!

MAINS:
DUCK CONFIT (4/5)
(With wild mushroom risotto)
Mm the duck confit was delish! The skin was very crispy with just the right amount of fatty and duck meat. The mushroom risotto was also great - it gets salty after a while but still a great mix with the duck leg. 

PAN SEARED CHILEAN SEA BASS (4/5)
(Saffron infused rice, caper meuniere sauce, diced tomato)
For those who would like something more healthy tasting, this is a good choice. A very light dish - the sea bass was tasty and fresh. I enjoyed this dish very much. 

DESSERT: 
TOFFEE CAKE (5/5) 
You would be missing out if you didn't save room for this dessert!! I looooved this toffee cake.

But, that place is long gone and I'm just glad I finally have El Gordo to fill the void.

The adobada tacos ($2 ea.) are every bit as good as everyone says they are. The best part of the pork were the pieces carved from the exterior of the pork on a spit. They had an amazing crispy, charred edge to it that added to the transcendent flavor and texture combinations of the tacos.

And, don't forget about the carne asada tacos ($2 ea.). They're some of the best I've had in town. The quality of the beef was outstanding. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the slimy green faux-guac sauce covering the meat. Next time I'll just have to get the tacos plain, with nothing but onions and cilantro.

I went for the Grand Opening last night and was super excited to try all of these unique restaurants with inspiring flair on the standard dishes we know and love.

Summary:

The Rice Shop (essentially like a Poke place - but they did have a delicious looking chicken bowl with broccoli and rice. That's the one I'd grab since I'm not huge on the raw fish movement lol)

Tin Man (I think the vibe here is like... an All American experience. They have a DELICIOUS burger, onion straws, chicken and dumplings, pot roast, apple inspired dishes and desserts) 

Sauce The City (to DIE for crispy deep fried chicken with a bounty of flavorful sauces - Homestyle, Cleveland Hot and Sauce Fire Hot - which I can only imagine how intense that one is as I smelled the heat coming off a plate that passed by me. They have a fun spin on fire roasted corn on the cob and of COURSE, Sweet Tea!)

POCA (a very authentic Mexican restaurant. This isn't like your standard places. This is a straight from Mexico (classy establishment) type of Mexican (Oaxacan inspired to be specific) with chicken thighs and mole sauce and tamales. This isn't your ""grab a taco"" kind of Mexican. They have guacamole with a nice citrus flavor and robust jalapeño kick which they serve with a side of mole sauce - this stuff has some heat behind it, ayiyi!)

Now let's talk about the bar! And the seating! Omg you guys, we have too much to cover. Am I going to be flagged for saying too much? Will I run out of characters? The world may never know!!!

So once you pop in the doors of the place you can go left to the restaurants or right to the bar... ""right to the bar"" is usually my motto... tehehe. Never fear if you've steered to the left first... this place works in a circle and you can always find your way through the back end of the bar. The open floor and beautiful lights were amazing! Who doesn't want to eat in this kind of environment? The bar was very modern and offered up all kinds of ritzy true mixologist created cocktails with ingredients I had to google, of course. That's a mark of a real trendy place, I tell ya! They have a nice list of fun draft beers too!

The seating is spread all around the place and you can either sit at a larger communal table with others or a smaller table for intimacy. You set your number down from your restaurant of choice and some impressive treasure hunt wizards roam the floor to find you. Truly a difficult task, if you ask me. Kudos! I wonder if the training was successfully finding Waldo in a series of photos LOL - especially food courts. 

All in all I really enjoyed OCG! From a pocket book standpoint, it's not a place you hit up daily. It's pretty expensive, namely the bar, but if you're in the mood for some legitimately homemade cuisines and hand crafted cocktails with a more casual vibe... this is your place!!!",10,H5-d3Cja74mTgQ3eO0e-3A

I've now bumped up the rating from a 1 to a 4 for my overall experience.  Lauren L., Customer Advocate Manager, was great.  She promptly followed up with me to discuss my issues I was experiencing.  She was very friendly and genuinely sounded like she was concerned.  Also, my Loan Officer, Erik E, reached out to me to make sure everything was processed timely and followed through to closing.  Everything finally closed a few days late but none the less, closed and finalized.

I originally selected  RoundPoint based on feeling the most comfortable with my Loan Officer after a few initials contacts through phone and email.  They weren't the lowest rates but one of the lowest plus very responsive.  One thing I would say is be aware of and double check all the numbers.  After I decided to go with RoundPoint, they changed the initial offer by charging more fees.  Again, I choose to go with them because I was most comfortable with them but this definitely made be pay closer attention to the rest of the paperwork.  There were a few things here and there (could have been computer or human error) that I caught but RoundPoint corrected those along the way.  I guess this can happen with any bank, so I would recommend to check everything!

I was on the fence about the updated rating but overall gave the 4 based on RoundPoint resolving my issues and promptly taking action.  I feel the added stress and aggravation would have been nice to avoid in the first place but what's important is it was addressed and everything is done now.",2,7ARhTi9zkuOpzMWqv6oSAw

It is gorgeous on the inside as everything is brand new. The location has plenty of tables or various shapes and sizes for meet ups, relaxation and studying. 

I wish that I had the Barista's name that had waited on me this evening-the location closes at 7pm and during the summer months does not seem to be very busy, as the University is not in session. I arrived around 6pm and asked for my usual-a Grande Pike Place, no cream or sugar. The Barista apologized as they had no brew left-while there was only an hour left for the location to be open, he ended up brewing a fresh pot just for me! How nice-I have to thank him for helping me to get through my evening class today. 

My only complaint is that for a passer by in a vehicle, the location is a little bit hard to get in and out of - I ended up parking across the street on 5th avenue and running through traffic to get into the coffee shop.

The heat in my apartment stopped working last winter ('10).  The highest temperature my apartment could reach was 63 degrees, which was manageable for sleeping, but way too cold during the day.  

Each time you schedule an appointment with them, they give you a four-hour window when they will show up.  Not only that, but once they show up, it could be for another hour or two.  You essentially need to take the entire day off from work, sitting in your cold house for these guys to show up.  

I had to call these guys three times to come to my house.  
First time: The guy reset the heater.  it worked for about a day and stopped working again.  
Second time:  The guy said the heater was working fine, just that I had to put new AA batteries in my thermostat.  Unfortunately, I had to wait for four hours for the guy (he showed up close to noon), and I had to take off for some afternoon meetings, though I found out that evening it was still not working.  
Third time:  I was really busy at work, so ended up scheduling my appointment for almost a week later.  They still made me wait for about 3 hours.  

Finally, they got the heat working after three visits!  But then, in the summer, I noticed my air conditioner was dripping water!  Water was leaking off the ceiling and down the walls.

When we walked in, we were allowed to pick our seating and the server was quick to give us menus and offer us drinks. I whipped out my crappy Spanish, and he didn't seem bothered, which was nice (some people get offended when you try to speak their language and fail...whoops). 

I ordered a coffee and my fiance ordered the tamarindo. By the time we got our drinks, we were ready to order. My coffee was tiny! It looked like it was served in a tea set or something, it was kinda cute. Then I noticed the other patrons beside us also ordered coffee and got two regular sized cups...what?

Our food came out relatively fast for homemade food. We both had scrambled eggs (with tomatoes and onions), fresh sliced avocado, and fried plantains. My fiance's food came with refried beans and crema (cream), while mine came with casamientos (whole beans and rice, mixed together). Both were really delicious. They also brought us some tortillas hecho a mano (hand made), which were delicous and perfectly cooked. Mine also came with chorizo (Mexican sausage) but it was one tiny little piece; not significant enough for the price jump between the two dishes. 

Downside? With my tiny cup of coffee, I finished it well before halfway done with my food. They didn't come to check on us for a while, and by the time they did, I was really thirsty. They had to make a fresh pot of coffee, understandable in the mornings, but then the guy spilled it all over the table and saucer and cup and then left....wtf? Thought this was kinda funny, seeing as I would have offered a napkin or a new saucer or wiped it up....

Overall the food and coffee (what I drank) was delicious. Would have liked them to check on us a bit more regarding refills (I drank half of my fiance's tamarindo while waiting for more coffee, and they never gave him anymore either, or offered us water; didn't give us an opportunity to ask either, after the coffee incident). We were waiting for the check for a few minutes after we finished, stacked the plates and piled up the mess, went to the restroom, etc. and they never came. We waited until we saw another guest walk up to the register, and decided to head up front too, though its a bit odd for a sit down restaurant. 

Would come again for the food, but will be prepared to ask for refills in advance and specify what you want (I thought the sausage would have been different; I should have asked, shame on me). I do recommend the food. I usually can't bear to eat eggs (because they taste or smell funny to me) but these were great. Job well done.",0,YnMHlGm6XX1MtnKqiSgDIA

To be honest, it was disappointing. We were there early, and I always wondered why there was a line out the door. The reason being that you order and pay up front and hope they have a table. The menu is a giant chalkboard that is kind of hard to read. We luckily were one of a few groups there so we didn't have any trouble. 

We got 3 entrees for 3 people. The Large Shrimp, Pork Chop, and the Lamb Shank. We did not get any drinks, sides: or apps. Our total bill before tip $55.00. Now after paying that much, sitting at the table, and getting the sauces. Our food came. The pork chop was a nice portion size that came with a little salad. The lamb shank was a small size that came with some orzo, and the shrimp. 10 little shrimp. Was the food tasty---yes. Was it worth the money? That's another story.

Now listen, I cook a variety of dishes regularly. I' m a novice baker. I'm a foodie and appreciate great tasting food. I understand that portion sizes may be smaller at some places. I have paid for small portions and felt that it was worth the money. But for $18 and to get 10 shrimp that is supposed to be an entree (aka main course)--no matter how good is disheartening.

it has some grocery items, so if you are wondering what filipino food taste like or how the usual store is in philippines...go to Lolit's that is how some of the eatery back home.

i love their pinakbet as well. there are so many good food there. it depends when you go...the food entre changes..you can also call in and pre-order and you can go pick it up.

they also serve breakfast stuff, again, just need to call and they can prepare it for you. they are open 6 days a week. i think its like 10-7pm is their store hours.

i highly recommend to try it out, but its only take out. so, go to the eatery after work (if you work regular hours that is).

oh, if you have parties, you can order like for big group. i guess you have to go there prior then order and pay, then you come pick it up on the date you need it. i si say",0,OpLYM_y6ReDz6dEv8_ra4A

Long story short, we were at the wrong casino.  We decided to stay at Palazzo.  We love the Palazzo and have never had a bad experience here and figured we couldn't go wrong.  However, this is my least favorite dining expereince I've had to the Venetian or Palazzo.

SushiSamba was having their happy hour on Friday 4-7.  We sat up at the bar and ordered off their happy hour menu.  We each decided to try the Caipirinhas.  I'd equate this to a Brazilian margarita.  I think the bartender said it has rum instead of tequila???  Not positive though.  She hands the drinks to us and says something to the effect of ""This isn't my favorite drink, but it gets the job done"".  We didn't ask her if it was a good, bad or indifferent drink.  We just wanted to try something off their happy hour menu that we'd never tried before.  I thought it was a rather odd comment to make.  Then when we tried it, we weren't crazy about it either.  If she was going to say something, she should've told us when we ordered.  Regardless, the drink kind of grew on us.  Didn't order a second and probably won't order the drink again, but it wasn't horrible.

As far as food, we tried the chicken anticuchos, shrimp tempura roll, salmon taquitos and yellowtail seviche.  Chicken anticuchos were good....basically a chicken skewer with teriyaki.  Shrimp tempura roll was average.  Salmon taquitos were kind of strange...if you do order these, make sure to put the spicy sauce on them.  Without the sauce, they aren't very good.  Last but not least, the dish I truly enjoyed was the yellowtail seviche.  The yellowtail was buttery and spicy all at the same time....very good.

All said and done, our tab was just under $40 before tip.  Not bad.  However, there was something about this place, I don't see myself ever coming back here.  Other than the yellowtail, nothing was that good.  Average to mediocre at best.",1,NEN5RFpZp7DE6K1PK2KZzg

So I live close by here and I have tried this restaurant a few times and never had the best experience but after today I have given up all hope. I went to have lunch there with my friend and when we walked in the hostess was just looking around and so we waited in the doorway for a second and then I said ""hi there"", again she was doing nothing but looking around.. So I finally said ""hi, 2 please"" and she did not even respond, she just picked up menus and so we followed her to our table. Then we sat at our table for I'm not even joking atleast 10 mins. We saw 6 girl servers walking around the almost empty restaurant and none of them ever acknowledged us. I would have gone to ask the hostess if we had a server but she so clearly hated her job that I knew she would be no help. Finally the pack of 6 servers were standing together and I hear one of them go ""who has that table"" and all the girls just look at each other. One of them finally comes up to our table and says sorry she was caught up outside and she will be our server. We give her our drink order and ask to order our food now as well. (Obviously we were ready to order since we had just been starring at our menus for 15 minutes). The server did not seem happy about this. So we order an appetizer and our entrées and the girl walked away. After about 5 minutes a different server comes and drops off our drinks. And later a different server brings our appetizer while our server is following behind her with our entrées. While it was nice that our food came out quick, we would have obviously wanted a little time to enjoy the appetizer so our entrées wouldn't have to sit there and get cold. Our server never came back the entire time that we ate, both of our drinks were empty. The food there is spicy, so obviously you want a drink while you're eating. The server finally came back at the end when we were almost done with all of our food and asked if we were ready for the checks, never even offering to give us refills. Overall it was just a horrible experience. The staff there either just hate their jobs or don't care at all about having a sense of urgency... also maybe the servers should just have an inside or outside section, not both considering they can't seem to remember where all their tables are.

The wine was great; I have nothing but praise for our wine! As for the empanadas, I think I could get better frozen empanadas from Trader Joes. They're ok if you want that frozen, heated in a convection oven type of a meal- which I do sometimes, but just not at top dollar. The meatballs were ok, a little hard- like maybe they put too much bread crumbs in the mix. They weren't the worst, but they had a sort of golf ball element to them. The flatbread was good, because hey- how can you screw up bread?

I could easily go on and on about how amazing this place is, but it would inevitably repeat what many others have said so I'll try to make it short...ish.

After being TERRIBLY dissatisfied with The Scottsdale Veterinary Clinic I seeked the guidance of Yelpers to help me find a new Vet for my dog Slapshot who was having a mixture of issues with arthritis and stomach problems. After reading so many good reviews of BCVC and comparing them to various great reviews for other places, my gut instinct (and the feeling that BCVC treats 1st time visitors with love and care; many other places have good reviews from folks going there for 20 years. That doesn't help me determine how they are with 1st time visitors) led me to give them a try. BOY am I glad I did!! I called one morning and they were able to get me in that afternoon with Dr. Ryan. She is a GODSEND when compared to the many vets I have visited in the past. She is kind, honest, INCREDIBLY caring, and she understands folks being in financial distress. I dont make much money, so when it's time to go to the vet, I get that queezy, I'm-about-to-spend-$400 feeling in my stomach. Not anymore. After thoroughly checking out Slap's symptoms and actually LISTENING to what I had to say, Dr. Ryan printed out a quote and went through each and every option with me. We decided what was best to do now and what could wait. The quote was for over $400 and I left, HAPPILY spending $179 (X-Rays & Exam), despite the potential that Slapshot may have a life-threatening tumor. She was so thorough and caring that she wanted me to give her a call the next week to bring Slap by so she could feel the tumor and see if it was growing or shrinking, free of cost and appointment. All I had to do was call to make sure she was there and I could stop by.

Turns out, Slap was having some issues with the aspirin we started giving him for his arthritis and after 2 weeks, he was acting kinda strange. We called and talked to Dr. Ryan and she wanted to set up a formal appointment to make sure she had the time to do a thorough exam. After an in-depth exam, we have noticed a decrease in the tumor size and believe the intestinal problems were due to the aspirin. She prescribed 2 pills to help clear out his GI Tract as well as Tramadal for his arthritis as it will not have the harmful side effects of aspirin. (Despite prescribing 3 medications, she is very fond of providing over-the-counter and ""natural"" forms of relief. Foods you can feed, etc. in hopes of avoiding unnecessary medications, so those who feel like they are always bombarded by "" your dog NEEDS to take THESE pills"" will feel great comfort with Dr. Ryan)

When we were paying at the counter (which, I forgot to mentioned is staffed with awesome, caring, genuine people who you cant help but smile around and feel like even THEY care passionately about your animal) we were given the total of $42 for the 3 different pills and told that the visit fee had been waved by Dr. Ryan bc she wanted us to come in formally vs just stopping by for a quick check. How can you not LOVE THAT!?!?

Ok, I lied, this isn't a short review, but I just had to tell my story and this is only the surface of it. Long story short. I have NEVER been so happy with ANY Dr experience in my life. And quite honestly, if I go there and face $400 of work to make Slap better, I wont question her judgement one bit bc I KNOW she only has OUR (myself, Slapshot, and MY wallet) BEST interest at heart. She knows how much money things are and if she tells me that I NEED to pay for it, I will. I have yet to walk out that door with ANY REGRET.

I can't speak for any of the other Dr's (although everyone who comes in for care seems to leave the same way I do), but trust me when I say that Dr. Ryan is AWESOME and if you are looking to find a new vet, you should ABSOLUTELY give her a shot!! And the place is clean and bright and the staff is AWESOME and they offer treats and kisses (for the dogs) as you pay your not-as-high-as-every-other-vet-bill. Not sure of the general exam cost but I want to say it is $45 compared to the +/- $65 that I was charged at Scottsdale Vet Clinic (and a few others that I had called in the past). That alone is worth giving them a visit. Dr. Ryan and staff will do the rest of the convincing themselves!!

10 STARS and 4 PAWS UP!!!  Thank You Dr. Ryan & Blue Cross Staff, I have my vet for life!!

First,  it was packed, and VERY VERY noisy, I had to shout to talk to my table mates.  Second, we arrived at 6:30, can't recall when our drinks arrived (7PM?) but our first plates ($3 for 6 SMALL pieces of bread) arrived at 7:20.  The second round of plates arrived at 7:40.  Grits and an egg, which was good but strange.  The bread was long gone, so there I am eating just grits, and an egg.  The third round arrived at 8 PM.  I got the mac & cheese, which was cold; not lukewarm, COLD.   I got heartburn --- probably from drinking beer on an empty stomach and the weird parings becasue who eats grits and an egg on a Friday night and 20 minutes later cold mac & cheese?  Also got a sore throat from shouting and my clothes smelled like I had been in a cheap diner.  (But of course this place is pretty expensive, given the small portions.)  Oh, the wait staff -- there were four or five different people throughout the evening taking our order, bringing food and drinks clearing stuff away -- who is our server?  Who's service do we base our tip on?  They got orders mixed up, who get's what again now? I found it discombobulating.  Bottom line, I did not enjoy the expereince at all.",6,G_xEDEkC4z0G_ZLFWGPFEg

I have been loyal to an establishment once I get in there and see what the talent available is there. In san diego I was with the same salon for 8 years but in that 8 years I did find the one person I truly liked having my nails done by so I followed her to her own shop making our time together much longer. So in saying that, I havent been in Vegas long enough to setup more than an establishment loyalty.
Then I met Sasha. I had been going to a salon here for a while but I guess I was somewhat tired of feeling like a number and getting frustrated with intermittent shotty nails that would last a month one time and then fall off 2 days after getting them done other times. I found Sasha through yelp and others working in the Icon Salon and after seeing her work and verbally hearing her praises I decided to get an appointment and try her on for size. Sasha is very talented when it comes to nails. She uses the gels (which I hadnt ever done before and was seriously skeptical of because I am seemingly hard on my nails). She does 3D artwork and shes open to new designs and suggestions. She prefers her clients to be somewhat knowledgeable of what they are asking for from her as an artist. She doesnt use the dremel looking sander to prep the nail for fills, rather she uses just a nail file. This is beneficial to your nails as it doesnt dig down into the bed of the nail and cause the nails to be so thin and brittle. This is a huge advantage for me in that I have been wearing nails since I was about 20.
I highly recommend Sasha as she is easy to get along with and you will be getting quality nails by choosing her as your ""Master Nail Specialist"" (yep, made that one up!).",4,RdMD77Uwe8Mjy_EptbPa3g

I ordered one of the company's much talked about photo books shortly after Christmas. I uploaded the photos from my phone via the Shutterfly app and after filling out the billing and shipping info, I know that I had probably only spent a handful of minutes designing the look and feel of my book. Seriously, my part was done and over with after maybe four minutes and then I called it a day. I didn't put much effort forth in creating my ""masterpiece,"" so I didn't know what to expect. I'd never used Shutterfly before this, but the process seemed pretty quick and painless, not to mention fairly inexpensive, so I was down for it. After all, I didn't spend hours copiously designing fancy borders and all for my book, so maybe my expectations were not ridiculously high.

I received my book in the mail before the estimated ship date, which meant the turnaround was  about 8-9 days. I thought that post-Christmas, the timing seemed pretty reasonable.  Overall, I was pleased with the majority of the book. The cover looked great and most of the pictures came out quite well. However, two of the photos that I uploaded from my Iphone that looked exquisite as they were didn't come out so well. For some reason, they were not cropped appropriately or anything. It's like they just cut off at the bottom. I don't understand it and I was rather looking forward to seeing those two photos in my photo book as they appeared in their original form, but unfortunately, the shots (which were selfies) don't look like they do on my phone or on FB or Instagram, where I also uploaded them.

I'm disappointed by that and had no idea that they would turn out like that. Did I need to crop them myself or was that the fault of Shutterfly? I truly don't know, but either way, I don't see why the perfectly gorgeous photos were laid out as they were on the pages when they don't look like that in my phone or when I printed them from FB. Weird.

The rest of the photos looked high quality and the pages were laid out in the order in which the pics were uploaded to the app. I was pleased with the rest of the book, the cover came out just as I hoped it would and the overall price of the book wasn't bad (retails for $29.99 and up), especially with the first time user discount applied to it. Still, those two shots that were haphazardly chopped off do stick out like a sore thumb. 

One odd thing that I noticed, though? The photo book pages have a rather distinctive, fairly strong smell to them that I hope will dissipate with time. 

Will I use the Shutterfly app/website to order more products in the future? I'm willing to give them another try. I still like the overall product and the process is as easy as can be. I'm a busy girl, so something that is that user-friendly always gets points with me.",13,ZPGGhPerGYby3RARwRsRUw

Within approximately 5 minutes of entering Bang Fitness I was flat on my back on the turf while a bearded man palpated the bony prominences of my pelvis. And you know what? I liked it. That's not because of a case of pogonophilia (Google it-it's real!) but because this was Geoff, the owner of the gym, and he wanted to see if I was physically OK to do the class I'd signed up for. Somebody actually cared enough to ask about injuries and experience before just taking my crumpled deal voucher and running.

They say they do things differently at Bang, and that was evident even before I first arrived. I had bought a Groupon for classes, and in typical fashion left it until it was near expiry to use. They were prompt in answering emails and after a few failed attempts I eventually made it in for my first class. I was a bit confused by the setup intially. It's on the second floor and I could mainly see an MMA gym. It turns out that the MMA bit is on the left and Bang is in the same space on the right after you round the initial corner. You have to take your shoes off when you walk in the door and in the changing rooms so I erred on the side of caution and brought indoor shoes. You can often work out barefoot or in socks too. 

The strangest thing about Bang is the people who work there. They're all incredibly nice and friendly. They learn your name and remember it. They know when you've been in and what you've done. They notice if your form slips and correct it. They increase the intensity if it looks like it's too easy. They are all super enthusiastic about getting you moving well and avoiding injury. It's like physio and a kick-ass gym combined. I felt like I was being welcomed into a family!

Most of the classes I did were with Steve-kettlebells and Friday morning kick-ass conditioning. I absolutely adored and still adore these classes. Sizes are generally small (max 12, often less). They are always challenging but always fun and you absolutely will get fitter. I will probably always maintain that it's a good idea to actually learn some basic kettlebell techniques before trying a class anywhere; but they do correct form at Bang. The KB class is usually 5 exercises for 3 sets; then a second set of 5 for 3 sets before tabatas. Izumi Tabata is a Japanese researcher who was part of a group that came up with the bright idea of trying to kill you for 20 seconds followed by 10 seconds of rest for 8 cycles. I looked him up on Google images to see if I could get revenge. He looks innocuous so I could probably take him. I'd have no hope of taking Steve down unless he tripped over me. He's a strong guy. To be fair though, they're worth doing-they've been proven to increase conditioning. And the guys here are all about the research. 

Kick-ass conditioning is different every week. I just love it because I never know what to expect. It's circuit style and I've done stuff like hit a tire with a sledgehammer, I've pulled and pushed a sled, done box jumps, slammed medicine balls and carried a keg.  You never know what's in store but it is always fun and it is always a great workout. It cures any inner rage. Steve is funny and the time just flies.

I did one Olympic lifting class. I was terrible but Ron was lovely. He was so patient, the class was small and technique was heavily emphasized. It's a pity it just didn't fit with my schedule to go to more.

I did one circuit class with Andy on a Monday which was different again-band work, kettlebells, lunges. I knew I'd been working the next day!

I decided on a trial month which included a programme and 3 semi-private coaching sessions. They do a full assessment on you including a functional movement screen and devise a programme to fix deficiencies and help towards your goals. I tried some exercises I had never done before and got lots of useful tips and corrections on things I'd been doing for a while. I'm even trying to put my shoulders down where they should be while I type now. My nutrition consultation was mercifully brief-I basically said I knew I was eating badly anyway. We discussed more habit-based nutrition tips which was nice and has made more of a difference than if they had just handed me a diet plan and expected me to stick to it. As if! I'm excellent at ignoring diet plans. 

I ran out of space to say more but agree with the other reviewers (also read filtered)!

At the moment, my plan is to sign up for a class card because it doesn't suit me time or money-wise to get membership. I'm not willing to leave the place yet though and enjoy the classes far too much to not go again. And I'm not usually a group exercise type! Definitely go, check the place out. Do a drop-in class, have a look around, consider a trial month. Doing things differently is exactly what is needed!

 I love good jajiang mein and jampong.  I was so excited about coming here.  This place is disappointingly average.

We ordered jajiang mein, jampong and Gan Peng Ji.

Jajiang mein..sauce average.  Noodle was in one big klump, which means it was sitting there for a while before they brought it out.  In my opinion these noodles should be al dente (as the Italians would say) or QQ ( as the taiwanese would day) or chewy and springy (as Mike K) would say.  You guessed it...these noodles are not. 

Jam Pong.  I got the non spicey since my stomach has betrayed me and I can't eat spicey now.  But even with no spice this broth was excellent.  But the noodles....just like the jajiang mein..has no body or chew.

Gan Peng Ji.  I don't understand all these places that make it with a tomato paste.  It's supposed to be a soy garlic sauce. Here they make it with tomato paste.  Not only is it not good..but really over priced.  Normally korean restaurants give you a big portion of this even if it's not good..but here..small for $14.99.

The moment you step inside, it does appeal you giving you a sense of cleanliness and luxury. Once you are seated in your table, you get this cramped feeling - obviously the restaurant is a bit smaller and has packed more tables than it should. You are provided with bread and oregano as a free appetizer. Not very appetizing, would have loved if they had hummus instead. The menu gives you a variety of Mediterranean options with some sandwich options that may be for the not so adventurous patrons. The options are indeed fun with a twist. The Arrarat cutlet gets a definite vote of innovation from me - a chicken hot pocket packed with spinach and mushrooms! The food came in with an extra delay than you would normally wait for. I could relate the delay with the 'now hiring' sign posted on the outside door. The food wasn't so bad - but it didn't really seem like a carefully orchestrated menu. You can order three sides from hummus, veg Salad, rice, French fries or mashed potatoes. Except for veg salad and rice, I found it rather difficult accompanies to meat. Are you supposed to choke down on the hummus or mashed potatoes? The French fries are not your regular American fries - I found them rather larger chunks of unappetizing steamed or baked potatoes. For a cuisine known for their meats, found that their chicken or lamb was not succulent and juice. They were much more hard and rubbery, it does definitely become a struggle point of your meal. The portions are good but it's on the pricey side - about 35-40$ for two with just entrees.

Summing up Arrarat definitely tries to set itself apart from other Mediterranean restaurants by giving a great ambience and styling, with an innovative menu. With all that well done, the food is not top of its class.",0,u-NbxbNdh7GZGnwxXUitYg

The menu on YELP is very confusing.
Dine in date: July 30, 2014

We chose Menu A $250 (l'amuse bouche, 2 apps, 2 main courses, 1 dessert, a seductive sweet cart), the cheese trolley was extra so I'm not sure why they have it on the above link.  Also, sometimes they change their menu around (I think).

L'amuse-bouche: something with kale
it was just average

COLD APPS:
L'oursin - sea urchin in orange vinaigrette, delicate gelee of green asparagus with turmeric.
Le Crabe Royale - Alaskan King crab, salad of avocado & tomato in a heart of romaine & olive oil.

I got the sea urchin, my partner got the king crab; I don't recommend the sea urchin.  I don't like to the fact that it seems like you can taste the fishiness.  If you like Chinese bamboo shoots that smells like cow fertilizer or urine, then try it...but I don't like it.  

HOT APPS:
Le Foie Gras de Canard - Grilled foie gras, bell pepper confit in acacia honey.
L'oeuf de Poule - Deep-fried boiled eggs in light Comte cheese sauce with iberico de bellota ham. 

Foie gras was cook to perfection, this was awesomely delicious...my mouth is watering as I'm typing this review reminiscing the taste of the perfect foie gras in my mouth.

I can't remember if I like the deep-fried boiled eggs.

MAIN COURSES:

La Langouste - Spiny lobster roasted in a shellfish jus with spinach leaves and lemongrass emulsion.
Le Bar - Pan seared sea bass in salted butter with baby artichoke sauce.

Both tasted delicious.  My partner LOOOOVEd his sea bass more than my lobster.

Le Boeuf - Beef cheeks braised with eggplant in red miso & ginger sauce, medley of bell peppers
Le Poulet Fermier - Caramelized farm chicken with foie gras, farro risotto with snow peas.

Beef cheeks were tender, my partner didn't care for his chicken dish because he was expecting the foie gras he tasted from mine. 

DESSERTS:

Les Herbes - Green chartreuse sabayon topped with herb sorbet & a hazelnut praline
L'Abricot - Sugar pearl filled with apricots & panna cotta, cubes of seasonal fruit gelee with verbena.

Les Herbes was the winner on this one.  The L'Abricot was too citrusy for me. 

Mignardises - seductive sweets trolley 
I asked for 1 of each but they told me only 5/ person can choose 1, so we had 10 different things.  Surprisingly, I didn't like the macaroons.  Creme Brulee was OK...I didn't care for a lot of the sweets they offered on their trolley.

OVERALL, if you have the money, won a lot of money, love french food, just want to try fine dining or in vegas; then you should try it, after all it's the only 3 Michelin star restaurant in Vegas.  
I like how they give the diners the freedom to choose whatever you like instead of 1 table getting the same kind of menu or chefs tasting.  So yes, if you prefer getting a main course while the other party at your table is getting 11 courses so you can pick on theirs then you're allowed; different than Melisse & Providence.

I'm giving this a 4 star because I was famish upon our arrival and was experiencing hunger pains.   The service of just giving us a menu took too long.  They also messed up on our bill & charged us an extra $169, but they corrected that error.  Everyone will have different experiences.  I'd definitely would like to come back and just order the foie gras & maybe try other things depending how much I win at the table.",6,86AFTm6d4S85eFUK9gcG_Q

As I watched them build my burritos my heart sank and I knew I wasn't going to be in for a pleasant experience. The meat was wet, beans were swimming in goo and the tortillas split from the wetness as they wrapped it. My wife's bean and cheese burrito was even worse - 48.5% rice, 48.5% wet beans, 1% of a tiny sprinkle of cheese.

When we went to eat our meals the burritos were predictably soggy, vaguely unpleasant tasting -- revolting beans -- and generally yucky.

As I waited for my order, I witnessed a waitress/hostess with long blonde hair (few dread locks in the back) who was so terribly rude/mean/disrespectful to several customers. She threw her hands in the air to a lady who was inquiring about a few empty tables and said very rudely and loudly and in the lady's face, ""Be My Guest, take the table!  It is meant for larger parties, but go ahead and do what you want"" And then she threw a glass bottle with such force into the garbage can where I was sitting, it broke in the can. Next, several men were standing in her way and she very rudely said, ""move over there, you are directly in my way""... Not, ""excuse me""..  

Customer service and good food go hand in hand. I hope the people who pay her to work for them know how she is treating THEIR paying customers!   I am giving a 2 because of the atmosphere today. I was uncomfortable and embarrassed for the customers.",0,s49XcBEol0Zf4HsvB6TC2A

There are far too many other options in Madison and the surrounding area for top quality steak houses. 
 
The NY Strip was average at best and over priced- at $28.00. It lacked real strip flavor and if it was charcoal grilled- it certainly wasn't evident. 

The 6oz Salmon was also over priced at $30.00 but that was complimented by also being over cooked and not very fresh. That one-two punch was covered up by cooking it on a cedar plank and drowning the fish in a cranberry relish.",1,LLbJjNut0u2YWezPe1WmGg

The restaurant was a small place, and it was busy, but we were seated in about 10 minutes without a reservation. I've been here a few times and have had a good experience consistently. 

We were craving sushi, so we ordered a huge boat of sushi. We were each given a small bowl of salad and miso soup soon afterwards. The soup didn't have that msg aftertaste you'd find at some places, and the dressing on the salad was just right; not too sour, not too sweet, not too bland, not too much. The sushi came in about 10 minutes, and for the amount that we ordered, that was pretty fast. We had an assortment of raw fish, including no tuna and hamachi, as well as raw squid, avocado, and sea urchin. All of it tasted fresh and delicious. The sushi didn't have too much rice like some places, and the fish servings were adequate. We also got a soft shell crab roll, which had avocado, cucumber and cream cheese. My family didn't like the cream cheese in it but I thought it was good so I ate all of it.

What I find stood out to me was that every time I've went with my family, they always bring us something random that's on the house. I'm not sure if that's something they do often or just with larger groups. They use ""scrap"" pieces of fish such as the bits of meat missed when filleting a fish and make it into something delicious. This time, they made a hot dish of salmon pieces with onions, bean sprouts, carrots and sauce. The salmon was done well but had bones in it. It was free though so I can't really complain. It's a nice touch, and I like the idea of not wasting food. 

Overall, this is probably one of my favourite sushi restaurants and I'd definitely come back another time.",2,N-Ed3ymvxpW27VpY4cn-Ag

The event rooms are incredibly amazing, if I lived in Cleveland I would try to find an excuse to use them. Our room was clean and well prepared. The interior decorating is modern in style, which is fine, but poorly executed. For example there is no actual door in the suites between rooms. This is a problem when the whole reason you booked a suite was so that the baby could sleep undisturbed in the other room. beyond that, lots of weird choices: the couch requires that you recline at 45 degrees which is very awkward, the trashcans are about one liter in size, the water doesn't stay in the sink, the fancy faucets are difficult to turn on/off one-handed, etc. Looks very nice and I really appreciate the bare floors.

I looked at Prius V due to the price hanging from the rearview mirror.  When the salesman Chris C came out he said, oh that is not the correct price and told me it was $6000 more. I did not buy because I wanted to think about it longer since the price was drastically different.  I went back a week later and the car was still there with the adjusted price in it. I asked if they could go a little lower on the price.  He asked me to sign the quote if I bought it that day. I did.  He came back and he did not go as low as I wanted but was close.  I decided to go with the car.  He put all the papers together and gave my paperwork to the finance guy, Stratos. I told them I didn't have the title for my car but that I could bring it in.  Stratos said that was fine, it wouldn't make a difference.  I could take home the Prius and leave my trade in there. I brought the title at 9am the next morning. IT ACTUALLY DID MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I looked at my paperwork and they did not include the trade so I was charged tax on the entire transaction over $900 more, not the tax that they quoted me.  They also did not sell me for the agreed on price.  When I went back in to question this, ironically, no one could find the quote that I signed.  It miraculously has disappeared. When questioning the tax they said it was because I didn't have the title.  We asked to speak to the manager, TJ, and he wouldn't meet with us.  Instead, they said Statos out that said he works a lot of deals and we got a good deal.  He said that the quoted price was also not given since I didn't have the title when I did the paperwork.  Again, IT ACTUALLY DID MAKE A DIFFERENCE. It was a loss of over $1400.  He said that they did the paperwork right away to secure the car for me. It had already sat for over a week.

Original Review: 
Okay, so the Imperial Palace is definitely not the swankiest, nor the newest, nor the funnest place to go in Vegas. But it has one kitschy, old Vegas thing going for it - the Dealertainers. Don't get me wrong, it's not for everyone, but I love it. After a while, all those new places start to feel the same, look the same. The Dealertainers are black jack dealers that are tier 2 (okay maybe 3) level impersonators. They all deal cards and take turns going up on the mini stage to belt out songs - mental note, look for the speakers and DON'T sit in front of them. I had the pleasure of playing cards with Tina Turner, Stevie Wonder, Debbie Harry, Louis Armstrong, Billy Idol, and someone who may have been a very bad Mariah Carey (it was unclear). Anyway, go there for a different twist on cards - they had $5 minimum tables on a Saturday night - which is a rare find on the strip.",0,VQ-RXIZCH-7eRG8jSMmr9w

The meat is really effing good, and as a former Montrealer and Schwartz's regular, my opinion carries some seriously fatty, steamed, well-seasoned weight. Although not melt-in-your mouth like Schwartz's, Corned Beef House has some of the best smoked meat and corned beef I've had outside of Habs Town.

My fave here is the Reuben, but given the tastiness of the meat, the basic Montreal and corned beef sandwiches are both highly recommended as well. Now I'm just waiting for CBH to team up with the Pizzaiolo downstairs and make a smoked meat pizza!

The seating was extremely disorganized, which probably explained why the wait was so long. Customer service was poor, no one apologized for the wait, nor for shoving us into a tiny spot. 

Food came half an hour after we were seated.

We ordered the savory french toast and croissant Benny with peameal bacon (their specials). Overall quality of food was average, definitely not worth the long wait in the cold. The side salad was good though. We also ordered two croissants cos we were starving, the plates that the croissants were served on were hot, so we thought we were getting warm fluffy croissants. However the croissants were cold and hard, guess they've been sitting in their bakery for a while.. 

Overall, poor experience with this place, food was really average, I paid 22$, which was pricy given the quality of food and service.

Appetizers
Recommended:  - tofu rolls, chicken and shrmp rolls, sauteed squid (awesome), stuffed grape leaves. 
Misses: dumplings (why get dumplings at a Vietnamese restaiurant anywy), chicken salad (average).

Pho
Just go down the list...chicken pho, tendon, tripe, flank stteak...all are phenomenal. Seasoned perfectly so give it a taste before you grab the siracha or hot chili oil. I would recommend paying the extra buck or two for additional meat - and it's easily two meals.

Bun
Another home-run...the pork meatball is out of this world...typically get that with spring roll and maybe add another meatball...whoosh!

We hate driving to Vegas during the day so we always drive at night- much faster! We usually stay at the Marriott Grand Chateau but decided to stay at a different hotel to save money but we could not check in due to them being booked. 
Anyways, we were exhausted and needed to crash somewhere. The Artisan was the first result on Google and they had vacancies, so we went. 
My first clue should have been that I've never heard of it. I lived in Vegas for a few months, I drive in from CA all the time. But alas, we went. 
Upon pulling in, there is literally a 15 car parking lot MAX. And it is all valet. That's cool, but the valet is nowhere to be found. No problem, we just want to sleep. We walk in, and it is something. Badly printed art is EVERYWHERE-- the walls, the ceilings. There's a fountain(????), sculptures. Interesting decor to say the least. I give this place two stars ONLY because the guy who checked us in 08/01/2017 was so nice. 
So we get checked in, we get the car sorted out, we get up the weird red elevator, and to the floor. Also super creepy. Every room is after an artist, I don't remember who ours was, but it was terrifying. The freaky paintings were not my thing. Neither are the 16559854 mismatched mirrors. Not to mention, my 6'4 250lb boyfriend had to body slam the door FOUR TIMES full force before it opened. That shit was STUCK. On the plus side, we weren't worried about being murdered with a door that difficult.  We slept with the lights on. The rooms are small and very run down. Random stuff in the sheets. We slept like planks and prayed we wouldn't get bed bugs or worse. It was super gross. We walked around in shoes the whole night. We didn't even shower. 
All in all, this may be a cool spot for partying or something, but avoid staying here at all costs. It's in a bad part of town, its nasty, and the only redeeming factor is the people who work here are all very nice.",3,DFfT8_tgf-Sk7XHd8CRqWQ

I pulled into the drive thru and it didn't take long to hear Maria's lovely voice over the speaker box. I asked her for some time to decide on what I was looking to pick up because I wanted an assorted dozen. (Mmm)

I was given ample time to decide and did not feel rushed in the slightest. So I said I was prepared to order and Maria was there in a jiffy just as prepared if not more prepared than I to take my order. 

So I gave her my order flawlessly and she received in perfectly. I then pull up and she had my total for me at the window. We continued the exchange as any drive thru exchange would continue until the very end. 

This is where Maria really showed that she and her shop are a cut above the rest. She leans out the very narrow drive thru window risking intense sun burn and heat exhaustion in this Arizona (nearly) summer heat to ask me if I need any napkins. I was impressed with her bravery and care. I requested just one napkin because I only thought I would need one. But Maria leaves and swiftly returns with my donuts and hands them over to me and then tells me that she has given me two napkins. Turns out Maria knows me better than I even know myself.

I said, ""Can I make an appointment?"" She replied, ""Yes, when would your like a haircut?""

""As soon as possible,"" I replied. ""OK, come on in,"" she said. I immediately jumped in my car and drove the five minutes to the barber shop. I walked in the door to find both chairs filled and two or three guys waiting.

""Did I just talk to you on the phone about an appointment?"" I said. She snarled, ""I TOLD you I couldn't predict when someone would walk in the door."" So much for the appointment.

JAmQCmczUclNUfZjkNdjQA,0,2014-07-14 01:24:08,0,PS8DiSk3cTf2APzza9Z9Sw,5,"My wife and I were in Vegas this past weekend and wanted to try out the new High Roller to see what it's about. The whole area is new-ish. I'm not sure when it opened up but this was our first time here. The Linq has a lot of restaurants, bars and food shops in the area. We went with my parents as well. On the way to the High Roller, we saw they had kiosks to buy tickets closer to the strip. So we just decided to buy our tickets there to make it faster. We didn't know it at the time, but this saved us a lot of time!

When you buy your tickets through the kiosk, you get to pick a time slot of when you want to ride the High Roller. I would suggest giving yourself 20 minutes because it is still a pretty far walk just to get to the High Roller entrance and giving yourself some bathroom time.

The walkway to the High Roller entrance is where all the shops and restaurants are. There's a lot of music being played in the area. It seems like a really busy place and is a nice place just to stop by and chill.

When we got to the High Roller entrance, we saw a long line. Luckily we bought our tickets through the machine and we got to walk right through! So just a tip, purchase your tickets through the kiosk to save yourself some time. When you walk in the workers check purses/bags. Then you walk through the place. It reminds me of disneyland because of the way the lines are setup. We went on a Saturday at 9:10PM. We got really lucky cause we got to walk right through all the way to the top without waiting in any lines. They have an area to use the bathroom and buy drinks. I would suggest to use the bathroom since the ride is 30 minutes long and there's no place to go when you're in the pod. The drinks aren't that expensive. My wife and I tried the frozen drinks with some shots of alch.

You get grouped with around 20 people. The pods move continuously so you have to enter and exit pretty carefully. The pods have TVs inside that tells you how high you are and when you reach the apex of the ride. It also shows trivia and how the High Roller was made in a time lapse video. The views pretty nice, especially at night! You get to see the strip lit up. It was a super full moon that night as well. We got to see the Bellagio water show for a bit too. The pod has two seating areas. I would say the best place to go to in the pod would be the right side next to the entrance doors when you walk in. It has the best view of the strip when you reach the top. So try to make it out to that area if you can. But pretty much you can walk around the whole pod and enjoy all the views.

I would definitely recommend taking a ride on the High Roller if you're in Vegas. You can ride it during the day but try to go at night as you get to see all the lights Vegas has to offer. It was $35/person at night and cheaper during the day. Not that bad for a really good and fun experience.",5,wEnNhKTWaIh_zlngQ7S-TQ

This place does not know how to manage time or appointments, and the customer service is impeccable. I scheduled a 12:30pm appointment for a gel manicure so I could run over on my lunch since my office is within walking distance. I was traveling out of town after work and did not have time to visit my regular nail salon so I figured I would give this place a chance.

I walked in 10 minutes early to find that there were only three people working. There were also three of us waiting, two of which seemed to have been waiting a long time by the time I walked in. After sitting there for 40 minutes, other people who walked in after all of us waiting were taken in before me, despite me having an appointment, and the others waiting. Once all three workers finished their clients, and took on new clients, I knew I would be in for an even longer wait, so I walked out. 

Never once did they acknowledge me, the fact that I scheduled an appointment, or that I had been waiting for over 40 minutes on my lunch break. When I told them to cancel my appointment because I could not wait any longer, they acted as if they had no clue what I was talking about and never once apologize.

Hubby and I were big fans on Tagan and Frank's Amaro in Cave Creek, but sadly, things went way downhill when they left :(  We were eager to see what they came up with in their new digs, and we were over the moon!

First of all, just loved the space which is designed with comfort in mind. The spacious semicircle booths which line one side of the room are fabulous. I wish more restaurants understood the concept of the booth! And the bar . . . it has plenty of seating to schmooze up to it, grab a beer, kick back and watch a game with your friends. Nook could be trendy, but it reminds me more of a real neighborhood restaurant and bar, the kind like in my hometown of Pittsburgh, PA.  

The menu is eclectic, but favors the Italian cuisine. You can choose decadent, like the Arancini, crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside, with the best tasting fresh house-pulled mozzarella, or choose healthy, like the halibut tacos or albacore salad. For our first time, we chose decadent - the Arancini was delectable, and the langoustines were sweet and tender while the accompanying sauce had just the perfect bite. Hubby had the scrumptious Black Forest Ham sandwich which came with perfect fries. I couldn't resist the Gamberetti e Funghi pizza (shrimp, enoki mushrooms, parmesan and mozzarella).  I issue a challenge to anyone who says that shrimp doesn't belong on pizza!!!  Our informative and friendly waiter Jorge almost issued the same challenge to me . . . by remarking that he had only taken two orders for that pizza before and both were decidedly thrilled with their choice! The thin crust pizza was spot on . . . a melding of flavors and textures that really worked magic in my mouth. As an aside, I initially wanted to order it with gluten free crust, but they were out of it. I am not gluten-free as a medical necessity, but by choice . . . Nice to know they ""sometimes"" have it. You might want to call ahead to make sure it is available if that's important to you.

We love that the owners greet you at the door, and that they make time to check in with you, see if you like the food, have opinions, etc. They are eager to make Nook a place for you to call home and feel at home. No doubt we'll be back and bring a bunch of our friends with us!",7,qxmdrMmjTzgQhyHXKuyy3Q

But when I first walked in, I was greeted by friendly front office staff and a very comfortable waiting area. I even got raffle tickets to enter the person who referred me here! (That would be my fiance so that means the prize is mine!) They supposedly just started doing that this month! *cross fingers for a new GALAXY TABLET!!* After some new patient paperwork, it wasn't long until I got called back. 

First I was greeted by a dental assistant who took x-rays of my teeth. (thank you, i forgot your name, but you didn't scratch my gums with those plastic films).

I then met Dr. Pham who was very professional and got straight to work. I was really nervous because I thought I would see the hygenist first! I didn't get a chance to brush my teeth before I walked in (lame, but I know you do it too!) So I was quite alarmed.. But turns out it wasn't so bad. Still wish I saw the hygenist first though!

So Dr. Pham read out a few things to his assistant in a dental language that I couldn't possibly understand, and then laid it out for me.. I had a few cracked fillings and cavities that needed work on. We'll schedule that up front after my cleaning.

THEN I then met the hygenist, who thankfully diligently worked on cleaning by teeth without talking to me too much. I don't understand why some people insist on talking to you when you have metal instruments in your mouth! But not here! She recommended a thicker floss and gave me a few samples.

Then I was on my way!

I think I found the right dentist! I guess they are all not so big and scary.. :)

---------------------------

This next part is after my first dental procedure appointment. I came back to fix 2 cracked fillings. I was SUPER surprised at how fast the visit was.. less than an hour! (I dunno, I haven't been to the dentist in a long time, so is that fast?)

I was also super happy that I got a chance to brush my teeth and floss first *yay!

Dr. Pham did an amazing job numbing my mouth. I felt my ears tingle! He was going to give me more numbing juice, but I respectfully declined.. I know, so brave.. I should've just taken more numbing, but I was really hungry and wanted to eat dinner as soon as possible after the appointment. I figured, the less he numbed me, the faster it'll wear off.. lol.. and I was right!

Overall the entire procedure was QUICK and PAINLESS. I had to go back, so hopefully the next procedures are just as easy.

My wife had been here twice prior to us going on a date. Once with a gf of hers and once with my mother and hers. I was really excited to go tonight, and so glad I did.

I'm very very fond of patios in Toronto. There are quite a few patios I like but this place has my favourite patio now. It's not something you'd expect, my romantic, spacious but small, modern and clean. Perfect. The inside of the restaurant is quite small too but also clean, modern and romantic. 

The service was great. We were attended to by a few different people, all of which were naturally friendly and attentive. We did not have to wait long to be seated, to get our drinks, and to get our dinner.

The food was really really good. I mean, I would have licked my plate, as I've said before. I had the gnocchi with bacon and chicken, my wife had the home made tomatoe soup and mushroom bruschetta (although oddly it didn't made together - the mushroom and lettuce was separate from the bread with cheese on it). Our meals were still great.

I think for 2 drinks, two appetizers paired as a meal and my gnocchi entree - paying $54 and change was a fair price.

Hubby and I got there close to 4:00 on a Monday night and we were able to get a great spot with a nice view.  By 4:30, the crowd was increasing.  Our waitress was excellent!  I asked for a variation on the drink menu and not only was she accommodating, but she included it as part of the $6.00 HH drink menu!  It was a house-made Skinny Margarita (both hubby and I ordered it) and it was tasty and STRONG!  I had 2 of these delicious drinks, and that was 1 too many!  Yes, I'm a bit of a light weight when it comes to tequila, but still...it was STRONG!!  :-)

For food, we ordered Guacamole to share (YUM!!!!), hubby had the Filet Mignon Sliders with Blue Cheese (OMG, they were divine!!) and I had the seared Ahi tuna.  The Ahi was good, but it felt weird to eat it with a fork....I have NEVER eaten Ahi without chopsticks.  Sac-religious of sorts.  

This ended up being our dinner because it was so filling and satisfying.  Two of us ate fantastic food (to include quality Filet Mignon and Ahi) and we had 3 kick-butt drinks for under $35!!!!   That's a GREAT deal!!!

If it hadn't been for the fact that it was 110 degrees, we would have enjoyed the lovely outdoor area.  I hope that our travels bring us back here in the winter!!

We ordered the Hafa Adai plate and Beef plate then sat down. It took about 15-20 minutes to receive our food. First of all, they gave us the BBQ chicken plate instead of the Beef plate we ordered. Upon opening the box, we were hoping it to be fresh and hot because it took quite a bit of time to ""cook"" but it was just warm food. 

The red rice overall was a pretty good recipe but I've had better. The texture and tenderness of the chicken kelaguen was good but I felt like they completely overpowered it with lemon, as if I was eating a lemon warhead. Comparing the two plates and the given the price, the portions of meat given was small. On top of that, the meat lacked flavor, was not tender and poorly marinated. The filling of the empanada seemed to be drenched in oil and greasy. The thing I did enjoy was the finadene, which added flavor to the main entree meat. 

Overall the service was something I did expect in Guam. A very genuinely nice ambiance. The owners as well as their employees were very kind and hospitable. It made me feel like I was back on the island!  

If they were able to focus just more on the flavor and taste of the food, they would have a very good restaurant. To sum it all up the food was okay, but the Guam vibe made up for the experience!

If you are staying at the Linq you must check out this place! Its super good. We had reservations but it took about 40 minutes for our food to come out.

I had read about this place already and being that it's from the same owner that brought us La Carnita where the wait for a table is sooooo long, we called ahead to ask how long we can expect to wait for a table of two.  They said 30 minutes which we thought was ok so we walked over.  When we got there, we were able to snag two seats at the bar immediately (we were starving) so was pretty happy with that!

I'm always a bit wary of the pretentiousness of the joints in King West but Home of the Brave was refreshingly cool and low-key, not to mention quite reasonably priced considering its location and the quality of the food.  Our bartender/server was really friendly and she offered good recommendations for drinks and food.  Our food was served promptly and our glasses were always kept full.

We had the chicken handshake sandwich, fried bologna sandwich, lobster roll, and red velvet funnel cake (all shared, but a bit tricky to split the sandwiches which were generously stuffed).  All winners, but my favourite was the chicken handshake sandwich.  Having been pretty much raised on dim sum, the fried chicken foot didn't bother me one bit.  The fried bologna sandwich was delicious (not what you brought to school as a kid), with a generous serving of bologna on a soft eggy bun.  The lobster roll was also really tasty.  To be honest, we were full from our sandwiches, but the call of the red velvet funnel cake easily overcame my weak weak defense against dessert.  It was super tasty (though a bit too sweet for my tastes) and less greasy that what you'd find from a stand at Wonderland.  Came garnished with fresh berries which made me feel a tiny bit better about eating deep fried dough and sugar.

Would definitely come back here again...the rest of the menu looks pretty interesting and if our first visit was any indication, it should be really good too!",1,l-Z_P9JSkPoLmlhjR2dxeQ

When the ladies were checked in they were shown to the wrong size suite.  That was soon corrected.  Was told making original reservations that they had to be paid for in advance because of special rate.  Upon check in my card would not go through so they charged the someone in the wedding party's card. They had to come find me to get the charges off and put on correct card.  I had my number stolen and credit card company closed that card and issued me a new one. I didn't think it mattered since they TOLD ME I WAS PAYING IN ADVANCE and I was under the impression it was done months before.  On the plus side, absolutely beautiful decor and very polite staff. 
    We also arranged for Rehearsal Dinner in their restaurant, La Plancha. This was in a lovely side alcove area with special table arrangement and menus.  Lynzee did an awesome job. The food was fantastic. The service was incredibly slow.  It was embarrassing. They were bound and determined to hold off dinner and appetizers until they could run up the open bar tab for several hundreds of dollars. They did apologize. It took maybe an hour for any food to hit the table.  I had to get up and ask them to clear away empty appetizer platters after they sat there.  There were no other customers in the restaurant all night. 
    After all the hotel charges had stopped pending, I found I was confused since it just stated ""lodging"" for each charge. I wanted to go over a more detailed bill so I called hoping to speak to a billing department since it was more than I estimated. I was told I could speak to the manager Shaun and he would help.

5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ,3,2011-11-18 06:16:06,3,YXtXTR1IfTgjKPIq0fcSaw,2,"Back in 2009 when Don and I were just dating, I kept telling him about a ""Cosplay Lounge"" that was opening up in Vegas. I never got around to going and soon forgot about it because it didn't gain much popularity (nothing even pops up when typed into Yelp). Forward almost three years later and Don was taking me on a ""surprise"" lunch date. He parked at Monte Carlo and I had no idea where we were going. I never even knew where the Cosplay Lounge was located, so that's totally not what I was expecting. We turned the corner and he said, ""This is it!"" and I was still confused, because it said ""Dragon Noodle Co."" which didn't ring a bell at all. That's when said, ""It's the Cosplay Lounge!""

We walked past the completely empty lounge area and into the restaurant where there were only two other people dining. The waiter brought out our menus and told us there were currently lunch specials and dim sum. I noticed Don looking around all disappointed and he told he he was confused because he expected to at least see someone dressed in costume, but not a single person was. When the waiter came back, Don asked him about the ""Cosplay Lounge"" and the waiter gave him this extremely puzzled look like he had no idea what he was talking about. So Don started describing it and talking about the costumes and the guy said, ""Ooooh, that's not all the time. It's just at night on weekends."" By the way he answered, it sounded like he was even unsure of that. I have a feeling they don't even do the ""Cosplay"" thing anymore, but I could be wrong. 

After getting over the whole situation, we went ahead and ordered two lunch specials: Mongolian Beef ($9.95) and Orange Chicken ($9.95). Both came w/ soup, rice, and a Spring roll. On top of that we also ordered Salt & Pepper Calamari ($8.25) and Steamed Pork Siu Mei ($3.50). The Calamari was very different. It didn't come with any sauces and it came on a bed of lettuce with onions and jalapenos on top. We both really enjoyed it. Rather than relying on the sauce for the flavor, the dry toppings gave it all the flavor it needed and the jalapenos were a nice little kick. The Orange Chicken was alright, nicely breaded and cooked. The Mongolian Beef, however, was WAY TOO SAUCY. This pic I took: http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/deeOpEHwPHQpXvF7YYPIcA/l.jpg doesn't even detail the amount of sauce that was on it because the lighting was poor. It was like someone was having a water balloon fight in the kitchen, except with water balloons filled with sauce and one of them accidentally landed and exploded on top of my Mongolian Beef. I just stuck to everything else on my plate and picking off Don's plate. 

Overall, the two things I liked about this place were the ambiance and the Calamari. The service wasn't that great. The waiter only refilled our water once and that was when we asked him to do so when he brought out the bill. The only thing that would bring me back would be the Calamari and I'd probably order it to-go.",3,AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg

Instead, I typically do my reviews afterwards from my desktop computer at home.  This time, our older child was not with us so I thought I'd try ""checking in"" for a change.  Much to my surprise, a 10% off offer just for checking in appeared on my phone!  CooL! When I showed it to the server,  I asked if I needed to let him know about it before ordering or at the conclusion of our meal he stated,  ""We can do it now. No problem.""  

He was very attentive, brought our drinks promptly, and even brought refills before our drinks were half empty. The food was served pretty quickly and was good. 

When the bill came, the 10% had not been taken off.  Another gentleman came to accept payment.   Therefore, I had to explain the. Whole Yelp thing over again to him which was kind of annoying.

LET ME TELL YOU! it seriously serves a very VERY limited amount of different dishes. Their specialty is obviously topoki so they have one page where you get to create your own topoki dish ranging from type of sauce, meat, and carbs that goes with it. another page is where the snacks are and then they have another page for specialty rice bowls. they also have a selection of drinks as well. 
I'm pretty sure that with every item combined on the menu... there's probably just about 20 items or so... prices are pretty good. 2 main dish with a snack was about $36 without tips. 

Recommendations: 

Popcorn chicken snack: very well done in terms of crispiness and flavour. comes with 2 sauce: wasabi mayo and some spicy red sauce i forgot the name to.

Bulgogi kimchi cheese rice: rice on bottom and bulgogi on one side and kimchi on the other side with melted cheese on top of everything, sprinkled with seaweed. Let me warn you... this kimchi is abnormally spicy for some reason... STILL AMAZING though. 

Topoki with choice of red sauce, seafood, and ramen: this sauce is pretty spicy compared to the ones you're used to in normal Korean restaurants. It definitely does not have that hint of sweetness you're so used to. If you can't handle spicy... i suggest you choose a different sauce because you will definitely feel it a couple bites in.",2,VQenIJ5AzqURtDSUYv76rg

That said, how the hell does this place stay in business?  
I ate dinner there about a month ago, and the generally shabby quality of the food amazed me. The taco meats were dry and saturated with sugar (something I've noticed at other FF restaurants too), the tortillas were verging on stale, and the salsa bar, while always a good sign, contained exactly one edible salsa. 

Trying to stuff some calories in the ol' pie hole and get back to work, I doused my tacos in green Tabasco from the bottle on the table. 
Problem? It was horribly rancid, and the waiter I informed of this apparently didn't know that hot sauce can go rancid. I literally threw 3/4 of my meal in the trash can.

Like most people, the only reason I got mixed up with AZ Trademasters was because they were assigned to me via my home warranty (One Guard). The problem I encountered was that my AC was not blowing cool air, while also short cycling (turning on and off every few minutes). A technician came out rather quickly and determined that I needed a new zone control sensor. My issue wasn't covered under warranty, so I was quoted an out of pocket cost for the repair. Seeking reassurance, when I spoke to the owner, he confidently said that this part would fix my issue.

Guess what? It didn't.

I contacted them a second time. Another technician comes out, having absolutely zero back-story on the current situation. After filling him in, they determined that I now need a new zone control board. This also isn't covered under my warranty and will result in an even bigger out of pocket cost. But that's okay, as I was, once again, assured that this part would fix my issue.  

Guess what? It didn't.

After two failed attempts to fix my unit, the AC continued to not work, forcing me to contact them a third time. By now, we're passed the point of ridiculous. Unable to provide me with answers, they instead decided to ""research"" the issue with my manufacturer to see just exactly what could be going on. I'm sorry, but I don't have time to just sit around for several days waiting for repair people to ""research"" my issue.

While all this was going on, I decided to seek out a second opinion. Within a matter of hours, someone came out and very quickly diagnosed the ""lack of cool air"" issue, which was the result of a bad TXV.  And guess what? It just so happens to be covered under my warranty. Oops! I guess the techs at AZ Tradmasters overlooked this?

They eventually did the repair, although the owner explained that I still needed additional work done on my zone control, pointing out that my unit was in need of a specific valve. I was supposed to receive a quote for the additional repair, which I requested multiple times. I never received it. Then again, after two failed fixes and such terrible communication, do you honestly think I'm going to let them do anything else to my unit?  

I called my warranty company and demanded that they send out another company (Cool Blew). Guess what? The valve that they claimed that I needed was there all along! It was just well hidden and not properly set up. A few adjustments, a couple of thermostat modifications, and guess what? My AC and zone control system works. No new parts, no guess work, and no research needed. Thank goodness I didn't get duped for a third unnecessary repair.

Overall, I had a very bad experience with these people. Communication was extremely poor.  The only one who has any idea of what's going on is the owner, and even his communication was on the shoddy side. I usually had to call my warranty company, who would then, in turn, call them for me - as they obviously need to remain on their good side.

Because this company was assigned to me, I had unresolved issues for over a month! If the right repair company was assigned to me in the beginning, my issues would have been resolved within a matter of days, not weeks!

Bottom line: If you're a One Guard Warranty customer and you have an issue, request that they send another company out to look at your AC. After my horrid experience, there's absolutely no way in hell I'd ever let these people near my AC ever again.

I'd like to lead off with this disclosure: I love to visit the Philippines, it's a mostly gorgeous country, and the people are top notch. With that stated, my experience with businesses in the Philippines is pretty consistent: ""the customer is always wrong"".  This was also my experience at Pancit Adobo.

I ordered the Arroz Caldo to try the breakfast dish.  For $4.99, you get a delicious soupy rice and chicken dish and coffee.  Well, that's what you are supposed to get.  Instead, I was given a different Arroz Caldo meal (about $6.25) and was charged an extra $1.00 for the instant coffee.  I decided to discuss the matter with the person at the cash register.  The discussion went nowhere.  I then used a visual aid...the restaurants advertised breakfast special that was hanging on the wall.  With my finger, I pointed at their advertisement.  I was told that even though the sign said ""$4.99 breakfast includes coffee"" and Arroz Caldo was the very first item listed, it was really the dishes that were under the Arroz Caldo that were for $4.99.  What???

I liked the Arroz Caldo.  It was freshly cooked.  The coffee was fine.  Most of the dishes they offer are pre-cooked, out on display.  If you like your Filipino food fresh, this may not be the place for you.  If you like businesses that honor their own advertised prices, this may not be the place for you.

Finally, they simply took me here.  I didn't know what to expect in a remote area of town that was previously unknown to me.  I just ordered my favorites, and let the chips fall where they landed.

In this case an abundance of warm tortilla chips freshly made in house landed on my table in a woven basket, along with hot sauce and a bean dip, just after I had sat down--on a super-hard, wooden seat.  The chips and dipping alternatives were welcome sights for this hungry diner.  Soon two orders of guacamole joined this array, and I quickly forgot about my hard seat.  

The homemade guacamole was cool and creamy, but it still retained a few small lumps and tiny pieces of tomato.  If it contained any sour cream, it was not enough for me to notice.  The hot sauce was good and tasty, with medium-level spiciness.  The bean dip, slightly salty, was mild and addictive.  The chip basket was emptying fast, as one after the other worked their way to my mouth.  Service was excellent, as my water and Sprite were replenished without request, and I was even asked to hand over used paper napkins during the course of dining, so new ones could be immediately supplied.  I don't know if this was the regular level of service or influenced by my photo and note taking inside the restaurant.  But it was stellar service.

I ordered a Burrito Mojado, a wet carnitas burrito covered with Enchilada Sauce and a smattering of guacamole, that I suspected would be too large for me to finish in one sitting.  And I was right--especially because I ordered it with an a la carte Shredded Beef Taco.  The burrito, which was filled with carnitas, beans, and rice, was a bit salty but otherwise tasted great.  The Enchilada Sauce over melted cheese was mild, which is what I prefer.  I ate and enjoyed a little over half of the gigantic burrito that arrived before me, and packaged the remainder for a follow-up lunch.    

The taco in a springy, mostly hard corn tortilla, as ordered, tasted good, but I was quite disappointed that, although it contained adequate amounts of shredded beef, lettuce, and shredded cheese, this taco was sans tomato.  I often pay extra to make sure that I get tomatoes in my tacos, but this time decided that I would just eat what was presented to me as is.  I was surprised that the taco tasted as good as it did while lacking tomatoes, but still would have preferred some cool, red vegetation in that taco.  

Non-Mexican fare did not fare that well on this outing.  Diane's ordered Cheeseburger ran into serious trouble.  In two tries at medium-rare, the kitchen first produced a patty that was beyond well done, and then another that was simply well done.  And the forlorn patties each looked to be no thicker than 1/8 of a pound.

The restaurant had a display case that contained a Chocolate Cake, Red Velvet Cake, Carrot Cake, Cheesecake, and Lemon Cake that all looked pretty good.  So, I ordered a slice of Lemon Cake for sharing.  And, it was cold, imbued with the flavor of lemon, and pretty darn good!

Casa Don Juan has a nice, festive atmosphere with some interesting touches, like several pictures and photos of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo on a dedicated wall.  This is Old Las Vegas, South of the Border style.  And, based on what I ate and experienced here, I intend to return.",3,s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw

We planned to get to the pool first before the crowds.

So we took the tram-thing over to The Coffee Shop next to Pho in TI and the menu was just like what we were looking for. Eggs, Bacon, Sausage, Potato, Toast, Pancake.

But then a quick breakfast pit stop became a LONG and drawn out morning with minimal and very poor service by ladies in a very bad mood. It was not even that early! Like, 9am! Come on! They were so bitchy and unfriendly and had the most sour looks ever! I know this is not Disney Land, but do you have to make it a bitchfest so early in the morning???

People came into the cafe and then people who came in AFTER us started to get their food BEFORE us. It was not complicated food we had ordered. And Egg is and Egg really. You just crack it into a pan and watch it fry up and throw the hashbrowns onto the oil and whatever.

The bitchfest was contagious and we started to get bitchy and restless too, starting to join the mood of our servers. When the table that had the baby at it got their food at the same time as us - but had come in the restaurant an HOUR after us -- that was THE LAST STRAW.

We ate in bitchy silence fuming, having waited like 2 hours for a simple meal of Eggs. And the hashbrowns were tasteless and limp. Even I can make better hashbrowns than that.

To top it all off, the waitress LIED on the bill about what time we actually came in the restaurant, putting down a time, like, 45 minutes later.

I exited to the casino (and got hit on by a disgusting drunk man) while my friend bitched it up to the manager.

This isn't a big chain or anything like that.

He offers a variety of services, like I said, so I think you could pretty much bring your car here for whatever you want - routine stuff, or fancier things.

The most important thing I look for in a mechanic is somebody who I don't think is going to try and screw me, and while that's not always an easy thing to determine, Wassek is always to-the-point, and seems like an honest fellow. He could have tried to sell me 4 tires when I needed 2 new ones, and he didn't. He's never tried to upsell me on anything. I appreciate that - just keep me on the road, man, you know?

The second most important thing to me is communication - specifically around timelines. Some mechanics will be like, ""Hey I'll call you when it's ready"" which is a load of crap. Wassek said my oil change would be fast, and I was in and out of there in like, 15 minutes. Nice. He said he'd order the tires, and have them installed by like, 1 or something, and he gave me a call before 1 and let me know it was done and to come pick them up. Stuff like that makes it so I can keep living my life while my car is being worked on and I don't have to put everything on hold while I wait.

The waiting area is nice and clean and cool, and he's got wifi, and a camera setup so you can kind of watch them while they work on the cars. This place is also near a bunch of stores, so if you wanted to walk across the street to McDonalds or some fancy hippy cafe while you wait, that'd be easy.

We just returned from a Birthday trip for my daughter... we had four rooms at Bally's. The two rooms that were in the ""old tower"" were entirely unacceptable. They were not only old and tired but filthy and in total disrepair. One room even had a bloody hand print on the wall! Dirty linens, stained carpets, marred furniture, stained bathroom amenities, the list is long. We went to the front desk to see about changing a room and were told they were totally sold out so no other rooms available. Then, when I offered a tip, the nice young lady said, ""well I can probably find one but it will be an extra $75 per night"". When I told her that was ridiculous, considering they were already paying $250 per night, she kindly reduced the upgrade fee to $40 per night. How funny that she miraculously found a room! Extortion just like the old Mob days!

We had our choice of two free rooms at any Caesar's property and chose Bally's only because it was less expensive for those who had to pay. We will never make that mistake again. You could not pay me to stay there again.

The gambling was the worst I've experienced in my 30 years of experience. I don't expect to get rich but a simple return once in a while would have been reasonable. I didn't believe the horrible gambler reviews online about this place buy now I understand and agree.

The only decent thing about this hotel is its location. However, there are so many better choices in the area and price range. One bright spot - A couple of the staff members were very nice, particularly the lady at the Diamond Desk.

Pulling up, you wouldn't expect it to be as massive as it is, but first impressions mean nothing before you step through its gates.

Robinson Ranch is owned and operated by Mr. Robinson, who teaches riding classes, hosts therapy sessions, and hosts riding clubs that partake in activities from parades, funerals, and I'm also pretty positive civil war reenactments. 

The ranch is large and they have over 20 horses (several who were loaned/borrowed out at the time I visited). They also had pigs, sheep (I saw 3 that were born the same day, so cute!), and other animals you'd expect to find on a farm. Each type of animal had a clean enclosure with plenty of food and water and a great amount of space. People who treat animals properly are the people you want to support.

Mr. Robinson has a gang of volunteers that help in every aspect of the ranch and he is always looking for more. If I lived in the area I would definitely sign up. He screens every applicant and has every volunteer do orientation.

I cannot say enough wonderful things about this ranch. You should look them up if you're in the area and want to take a riding class or join a riding club.",0,B9J6L6fVSrJ3cT8lif3hkA

We have not brought our dogs here in a while as grass was barren and dog turds were abound.  Not this time.  Looks like it has been recently seeded and allowed to get established so I'm guessing it was closed for a while.  

So this park has plenty of running room for the dogs, a nice aggregate walking path for owners, water source for dogs and generally many other dogs to chum up with yours.  There are several permanent benches for seating and a covered shade structure.  Plenty of trash cans to pick up after your dog with poo bags available or scooping tools.  I just wish more people picked up after their dog or assume they did and pick up a pile you see to make up for missing your own dogs.

The bar occupys up to about 40 guests with well informed servers presenting your food to the guest over the counter.  It becomes obvious that you are at a Robuchon's vision of being a japanese  style counter chef.  But with Robuchon's stern eye in the room,  his food is complete in all forms but none.

The crispy thin tart of sweet onion and pancetta was offered with a couple of perfectly cooked quail eggs that burst with the mellow yellow yolk.  It was so delicious and it was garnished with a nice pairing of sorrel greens.  He had the fancy stuff too.  Such as the quail egg stuffed with foie gras and served with truffle potatoe puree.  Man it was good.  Very small and expensive... but it was worth it.  I think.
One dish stood out above the rest and that was the steak tar tar... Basically a raw burger patty with the fixings ... dijon. onions. pickles.  s&p... Served with french fries and a tiny little wedge of iceburg lettuce, I really began to think I was eating a burger and fries.  

The presentation is very precise and the line cooks take there time to get things right on the plates.  They move fast but take their time on the plates.  A sign of a good experience to come.  

But it just so happened that he was there that weekend and I got to meet the icon... practically a god to most people.  He is the inventor of new cusine almost.  But more then all of that, he is just a great chef.  I found he was a very nice man and up next  is hopefully the Mansion next door.  When I asked him how it was... he just smiled looked at me and nodded his head up and down with a silly little smile on his face and I trusted his every nod.",2,q_EBz-fGb5ZWF8NclKEhdA

Biting into the blackened steelbass was, well, fun, but the taste isnt' anything revolutionary and it was a bit dry.  The Salmon had potential for innovative dish, but it was overly sweet and vinegary, which gave it a generic cast.For dessert, we got the mini creme brulee, a highlight of the meal.

I will also mention that it topped out around 112 degrees that day as well, so keeping me happy all day wasn't an easy task.

The summer rate is awesome, via Golfnow.com we got a tee time at 11:36 a.m. for only $35 (including tax) per person. It also included a cart and as many range balls as we could handle. 

Once we arrived I quickly remembered we were at one of the nicest resorts in Arizona. People around to help with anything and everything. 
When we got there the guy outside got our cart ready to go while we checked in with the shop inside. When we came back the clubs were set, he had loaded the ice chest with water (complementary) and ice, made sure we had everything we needed and sent us on our way. Not before letting us know that we could take our time at the range, as there weren't many people out today so we could tee off pretty much whenever we wanted. 

We hit a few balls then to the first tee we went. I didn't play any of the holes, I was the birthday boys caddy for the day. So basically I sat in the cart, in the shade, looked pretty and pulled the pin every now and then. They had no issue with me just riding along, and I didn't have to pay. So awesome! 

The course is beautiful! Looks just as immaculate as I'm sure it does during the cooler months. The views were amazing too! We played too 9 hole courses, Oasis and Canyon. Both awesome. Oasis has a lot of water around it and really lush and green. Canyon was further up the mountain a bit, great too look out on the city. 

The drink/snack cart chica came around several times, loaded us up withmore ice and water. We were very thankful for that!

When we were finished, the golf dude washed his clubs and kept an eye on them while we went in to grab a cocktail at the bar.

It was a little pricey but the food and service were worth it. I think this is by far the best ""special occasion"" restaurant in the Phoenix area. Not as snobby as some of the places in Scottsdale resorts and far better food than Compass downtown. 

We started off at the bar since our table wasn't ready when we arrived. They have a variety of specialty martinis. The ""Great Fruit"" was a good sweet and fruity cocktail and the candied grapefruit slice made it special. I ordered the ""SKOCU THU"" which had a bit of spice to it and was garnished with a dried chili. It sounds weird but it was amazingly good! Definitely one of the best cocktails I have ever had. The bartender also made a smaller sized Mesquite Bean Martini for us to sample which had excellent flavor but I think you have to like Bourbon to truly enjoy it. 

As for the food, the menu is a little different and requires an adventurous palate. I enjoyed the Native American influence and focus on local food. We ordered an appetizer that had cured ham, raw fish, and buffalo tartare, which worked well since it had a variety of items to try and was a good for sharing. There was a small soup included in the meal (just a taster size) and also sorbet to cleanse the palate between courses. My husband ordered the Buffalo as his entree which was a good size and he said it had excellent flavor. I had the Seafood Potpourri which was also excellent though I am not sure how that fits in with their Southwest theme. The only criticism of the menu that I have is that the only poultry item was duck. So, if you are not a game meat or seafood person you would be out of luck. I did appreciate the fact that they had a good selection of half-bottles and wine by the glass because after the martinis we could not have handled a full bottle of wine. Since it was our anniversary they gave us a complimentary chocolate mousse for dessert and so that was a nice surprise but I think otherwise they still provide truffles as a finish.

For aps, my husband had the clams casino, my father-in-law had the wings, I had the ceviche, all excellent!  For dinner mother-in-law had the fish n' chips, father-in-law and husband had the harvest platter, I had the enchiladas with crab...amazing!  My MIL wanted the fish tacos, but she chose last minute the fish n' chips, and she loved it.  The boys loved the platter, although the crab cakes were less than desireable, and my enchiladas were the best seafood enchiladas I've ever had.  I have compared them to Maria Maria's crab enchilada suizas, these stand out beyond them.  

This place is like a sleeping secret, and I wanted to share this place should not be overlooked.  Its in the far southwest corner at Dana Park, is hidden, and is worthy of your seafood cravings!  

No more Red Lobster, people, give this place a go, and it is all sorts of family good, big tables, excellent food, good drinks.  Give to the locals, not to the chains.  They also have seafood for purchase, and its fresh as AZ can get it, and the prices are good.

And word of mouth is Havana Grill is the place to get your Cuban food fix. Although I was a skeptical to try this place because of Teri C.'s review and the other reviews as well, I had to try them out for myself. 

Fortunately we came in during happy hour, which was half prized appetizers. We ordered the Mezcla de Aperitivos (consisted of tamal, papa rellenas, croquetas, and cuban sandwich) and Mini Sandwich Cubano. 

Tamal- I didn't like their tamal at all. More dry than usual and no taste either. 

croquetas- we weren't sure what these were because there wasn't a description on the bar menu. Unfortunately, as soon as I took a bite I spat it back out into my napkin. Maybe this was a little too authentic for me. 

Mini Cuban Sandwich- the bread was nicely buttered and the contrast between the mustard and pickles was a unique mix. The ham could had been a little tastier, but good enough. I was really expecting more based on how much people rave about Cuban sandwiches. I'm really hoping other Cuban places make a better one because theirs was just A-okay. 

There was no papa rellenas at the time was I was kind of sad because they serve those at Porto's Bakery. I also ordered the guava shake, although I'm not a big guava fan I was trying to be adventurous. I didn't really enjoy this drink because there was nothing special about it and I prefer my shakes on the thick side and itwas rather thin. 

Overall, the experience was okay. The service was a tad slow and the food didn't really impress me. The inside is nicely decorated and still gives off the mom and pop vibe. However, I don't think I will be coming here again.",2,loOoIBFpGbkx8WaIpQndiA

I am so glad that we did.  While I balked at how much we spent, I can't help but remember how good everything was, and that it is definitely worth it.

We brought my other mom, mother-in-law, because she has a special appreciation for all things downtown and she had been wanting to try this place as well.  This place really is beautiful.  There is a modern edge to everything, but it's styled in a way that makes you feel incredibly comfortable here.  The staff is all unbelievably nice and friendly.

-French Toast Casserole: Sweet and tasty.  Like bread pudding in pecan roll form.
-Scrambled Eggs - Light and fluffy and well seasoned.
-Yogurt Parfait - Served in a martini glass with seriously good granola.
-Bacon - Very good and cooked well.
-Sausage - From Schreiners, very good but a tad to spicy for breakfast (at least for me)
-Biscuits & Gravy - Different.  It wasn't very sausagey but I really enjoyed the taste of it.  It was not as heavy as normal B&G.
-Fresh Fruit - The berries were served in shot glasses and were so perfect I couldn't believe it.  
-Mac&Cheese - Definitely not my style, it was really boring to me, I would actually be upset if I ordered it.
-Chocolate Mousse Cake - INCREDIBLE.  I wish I wasn't so stuffed at this point of my meal to actually enjoy it more.  The cake was super moist and dense, but the mousse inside was amazing.  I could eat a whole bowl of that stuff.

I couldn't have been more pleased with this place.  Everything was delicious and beautiful.  I felt strangely at ease here.  It seems to be a fancy place, but it wasn't pretentious like I had expected.  We had such a wonderful time, and our server Jeff was fantastic.

I tried to eat a Dunkin donut recently at a work event and literally couldn't finish it.

Because of my positive experience with the product, I was expecting an equally positive experience when I stopped by the shop last week for my husband's birthday. I wanted to pick up a half dozen of cookies to take home to him for his special day. 

Though the cookies that I purchased were very tasty, my experience was just...awkward. There were four women working, but none of them acknowledged my presence when I entered the (very small) shop. One of the ladies was blocking most of the counter (standing on the customer side) and it took her some time to realize that I couldn't see what to order due to her standing in the way. As I was leaving, she proceeded to block me from exiting as she picked up some sort of... bug, I think? from the ground inside the shop and placed it not far from the entrance outside.

My whole in-store experience was just strange and I look forward to returning to eating the treats that my coworkers provide, not picking them up myself.",4,cCke3VtFLtqgzkgYSrSE2g

-24 hour deal for the buffets such as Carnival, PH, Paris, etc. 

cons-
-parking is far 
-old people casino
-bad customer service
-worse room I have ever stayed in

Experienced the worst customer service here. When we got to the room, we were disappointed to see how ""big"" the room was...which it was not that big at all being a suite & all.. It seemed like a regular hotel room. 
The air conditioner sucked ass.. we had blasted at 60 and we were still fanning ourselves and that was after we had complained and they had someone ""fix it"" by replacing the filter.. I guess you cant expect too much since the RIO is one of the oldest hotels in vegas...
The towel hangers came off... yea..surprise surprise..

the bed sheets had nasty brown spots..

the refrigerator felt like a cooler would have been a better and cooler option. 

Lastly the pull out bed looked like it has been ""pulled"" all over the place.. the mattress was completely falling apart... it was sad for my friend who had to put up with it for one night and he even hurt himself trying to pull that disgusting old thing out of the couch. 


When I complained the next day all they could do was ""send someone out for repairs""... I really was not trying to upgrade to a bigger room just a room that is not terrible... even if it is the same kind just a different room. ..and I asked the lady how long it would take because obviously this is an inconvenience for us.. she stared at me with a nasty look and replied, ""well you can stay int he room!""..-- wow what an awesome customer service you just gave me you incompetent worthless customer service representative... I mean really I just want to be comfortable and do you really expect that we can sleep and feel like we have some privacy with 3 men walking around the room and fixing things and moving the couch out and putting in a new one? really? really? okay yeah sure I would love to stay in the room and awkwardly try to ignore the three men trying to ""fix things"". 


the casino sucked as well.. its all OLD people. like old people that smell.

they offer a shuttle every 30 mins but its too bad its only good until 1 am so if you are out partying late then you either walk you ass home or pay for a cab(about $15).


overall our experience here was terrible. 

I recommend that you DO NOT plan on getting a room here.
Get the 24 hour buffet deal if you dont want to spend a lot on food.. buy it around 7 pm and you will be covered until 7 pm the next day.. so that covers your dinner, breakfast, lunch, and dinner again. Just don't stuff you face just because its a ""buffet"". We took advantage and ate at the Rio, Planet Hollywood, and almost at the Paris for crepes but we made it too late.

I also recommend bringing your own blankets.. the brown one that they give you is gross and feels like its made out of foam.. its not comfortable or soft. 


don't bother looking into this hotel.",1,K7wS9o3PukRMBj0ch9kebA

3.  The miniature salsa portion with the burritos is a joke, especially since chips do not come with the burrito like they do at some alternative places like Rubios and such.  Even if someone wanted to dip their burrito into the miniature cup, it is too small, and the portion is too small to be of much use for gently adding it to one's burrito as it is eaten.

We ordered the beef pho and a chicken with Vietnamese noodle dish.  Both were perfectly seasoned and very flavorful.  The broth just seemed to be completely saturated with flavor.  I have noticed that some Vietnamese restaurants will put in too much salt in order to compensate the flavor of their soup.  That's not the case here, there's just enough seasoning to bring out the real essence of the broth.  Also, the beef was just rare enough to be soft and also add to the delicacy.

The waiters were also prompt with refilling water and packaging our food once we finished.  Even though Vietnamese cuisine isn't very complicated, it does take a bit of mastery to get done right.  This place is definitely on the top of our favorites.

52yWGkwnrQXIjvuMjYxsiA,5,2016-12-01 03:48:38,0,XuUhqG2ZQxsmSnxtugOUlg,5,"So, my fam moved from NYC to Arizona a few years ago, and I'm sad to admit that I may be a bit of a snob when it comes to deli sandwiches (at one time I worked minutes away from Katz deli). I can't eat a lot of meat, so when I choose to, I want it to be good. That's not too much to ask, is it? I'm also not a fan of dishing out $10 for a sandwich that has mass distributed deli meats and cheeses (yes, boar's head, I'm looking at you). After 4 years in AZ I've pretty much given up on finding a good deli spot.

So then... I come across a positive review from a friend and my curiosity rises... And I go with my kids and MIL to check it out.

On that first visit we ordered an N.Y.T. Cubano, a White BBQ pork, a kids Mac-n-cheese... Oh wait - then my 3 yr old decides he wants eggs... Really, kid? The staff, however, didn't seem phased... Everyone was super nice and accommodating. They modified his meal and gave him an egg salad sandwich. Everything was so good. The white BBQ pork is seriously the best meat sandwich I've ever had. But the Cubano was excellent also (not overpowering salty but superbly flavored). When the kids Mac first came out, I was surprised to see a very small bowl. But do not be misled by the small bowl, my fellow yelpers! When I dumped her Mac on a flat plate to cook it off, it filled up the whole plate and was way more Mac than I expected. Btw - it is delicious.

We came back a few days later with a larger crew (there were 10 of us this time), so we were able to sample a wider selection of their menu. Hubby & I got a White BBQ pork (because I've been craving it since that first visit) and a pastrami sandwich and split both half and half. We also brought our 23 months old this time and we felt like he wasn't going to eat a full meal's worth. So we got 2 Macs, and our 5 y.o., 3 y.o. & 23 mos old split it in 3. Again, no problem, the staff brought out 3 plates and there was still plenty of food. The other 2 options that were ordered that time were the Caprese sandwich & the meatball sub. I seriously don't like meatballs, so i haven't tried it personally but both people at our table who got it - loved it. It also happens to be greeter Sam's favorite sandwich. The caprese sandwich looked great and I might want to try it the next time I'm there.

And if that's not clear - all meats are made IN HOUSE!!!

Totally worth checking out.",3,zjfQ28m2cZuAEmC_AeuN5g

First of all, the reception staff is extremely nice and helpful, but the doctor is so rude and lacks people skills. 

Every year I refuse to order contacts through them because they're at a high markup (typically 80-100%) from what you pay online. They claim to offer price matching but then don't when they see how low the prices are. They always try to pick a fight about it instead of acknowledging that the prices are lower and it's now a competitive market place since contracts can be sold online. 

This past visit, during my annual exam, the doctor didn't do anything differently and charged my medical insurance because she prescribed me eye drops that I didn't even know I was getting prescribed until she asked where I wanted my prescription sent. I then got my EOB from my health insurance and called the office immediately and they said that I would not be getting a bill. Magically, a billed showed up yesterday and they basically told me that it was unfortunate that the doctor never told me she was doing a medical exam and that my medical insurance would be charged, but that I would still have to pay.

We got a bunch of different appetizers and quite a few entrees as well. I remember the food being good for the most part. The alligator was tender and juicy and the crawfish spinach artichoke dip was so so good. The Tomohawk steak was so amazing and came on a giant bone they let you take home for your dog if you want. The only complaint the first time was the Beignets I ordered for dessert. Im from New Orleans and Beignets are supposed to be fluffy and sweet and a bit crispy and covered with powdered sugar or honey. These were disgusting and hard and falling apart and tasted like gross old overused oil. They were barely dusted with powdered sugar and such a dissapointment. 

The second time I went was Oct 2014 with my boyfriend. I bought a groupon so I thought that would be worth it since their prices are a little bit on the higher side. We had a few of their specialty drinks which were good and had a great amount of alcohol. Then we ordered Gumbo and the Ahi tuna tartare (?) for appetizers. The gumbo was below average. It didnt have very good flavor and wasnt even very warm. The tuna was even worse. It was cut kind of sloppy and jsut drenched in whatever sauce they use on it. For entrees my boyfriend got Jambalaya and I got a catfish and shrimp dish. The Jambalaya was also under-seasoned with a small amount of shrimp which was added for an additional charge. The dish I had with the shrimp was actually tasty but just too small of portions for what I paid (I think about $22). 

Overall, I would probably return again but only if I had a Groupon and only for the crawfish dip or tomohawk steak.",1,ohboKlO6Kg5kBpWhEZF_5g

I've been especially impressed by the manager on duty on weekday mornings - he seems to keep things moving and pitches in wherever he's needed. 

I experienced a great example of this attentiveness a few weeks ago when I made a commitment to bring coffee into an 8am meeting but stupidly only left myself 15 minutes to stop and get it. I first went into Starbucks next door and was told it would take at least 15 minutes to get a carafe filled. I quickly ran next door to Einstein's to see if I would have better luck, and to my great relief, the on-duty manager saw that I was in a hurry and told me he'd ""get it done."" About 6-7 minutes later, after true hustling, he gave me the full carafe and all of the cups, creamers, etc.

Don came and explained what we needed and gave two options to fit our budget. We chose AZ Pool & Spa because of a reasonable price, the length of warranty but mostly the professionalism of Don during our quote. Don explained things really well, but it wasn't in a condescending tone that women can sometimes get from contractors. He made me feel completely at ease and was very sweet when he learned I was recovering from breast cancer- saying that the pool would be great for my healing in a geniunely positive and not salesman way. We scheduled the chip out and the team that came were great. They worked quickly and kept the area clean as they worked. 
Other reviews have said that the communication was bad- I had the complete opposite experience! We were doing some of the work ourselves (tile and plumbing) and if I had any questions, Don responded very quickly; offering advice on the work we were doing ourselves. He didn't need to do that but he wanted to make sure we had information to ensure the renovation was the best it could be. Offering hints to my husband like pressurizing our new pipes until last minute so we could see if there were any leaks before we backfilled them. (great tip-worked great!) 
We do have a very old anthony pool (about 50 yrs) so when the chip out was done, we found a lot of rusted rebar. Don had warned us ahead that was what Mike was going to inspect during the shell inspection after chip out, so I wasn't given any ""sticker shock"" when we needed to brownout our bottom and have some rusted rebar replaced. He was very upfront about the cost before we did chip out so those that say they were never told or had costs added on, perhaps weren't listening close enough during quote phase? 
After brown coat, Don was ready when we were. We just had to finish tile and let him know. We finished over the weekend and I texted him to let him know we were ready for the pebble finish. He was able to schedule for Monday! Again, opposite of what other reviews have said.
I'm an early riser and told Don his guys could come as early as they wanted to hopefully avoid being too long in the sun. They were at my drive at 6.30am ready to start! Watching these guys work was something else (not hovering!) they were so professional and quick and again, kept the area clean. They did leave their slurry container outside after they left but after chatting with Don, I learned that it had to harden and they would pick up the next day, which they did.
Next day they came to acid wash the pebble and again, quick and professional. After the guy left, Don called to let me know about filling the pool and what we had to do.
The pool took two days to fill. Mike, the other owner came by to put chemicals in. He gave a run down of what we needed to do for the first 30 days and some advice for thereafter. Again, in a non condescending way.

1.) parking is super easy and available on several sides of the property so that you can more quickly and efficiency reach the stores you're looking for. Call a store and ask if you should come in through Fashion Show Dr or Spring Mountain Rd, etc... It's easy :)

2.) the store selection here is a shoppers heaven. From the top fashion and luxury brands to places most of us need to visit every now and then like the Apple Store, it's all there.

3.) they have a brand new app you can download to always be aware of some of the latest specials going on, or simply see their directory of restaurants, stores, and more, all in one spot! :) I'm all about saving time and this app does just that for a shopper. 

4. The mall is super clean and always got a great energy about it. Ever shipped at a mall where the atmosphere was just dead? Yea, Fashion Show is the opposite of that, you come alive there when you visit. Maybe it's the shopping euphoria that hits you, but either way you'll see how beautiful a mall this is when you visit.

5. and lastly I'd just say plan to spend a while here. I recommend starting at the Starbucks so you have plenty of energy for the day. :) 

Enjoy everyone! I hope my tips and review help you. Happy Shopping :)

We got their late on a Wednesday night and ordered one of their large $2 draft beers and a full rack.  After maybe 5 minutes this HUGE plate came out with a full rack and a side of slaw, BBQ beans and bread.  The ribs fell off the bone and had very good flavor.  The slaw was average, but the beans were very good!  It was too much food, but I couldn't leave a bone with meat on it!

FYI $28 resort fee here per day and rooms were about $55 with tax 

Upon check in- no rooms available 'with my requested type' (NS King- regular room- ) so we were placed into a two queen bed room for the night. (wasnt happy about that- my BF is larger- we were pretty squooshed in that bed!)

Next day we had to try to get the 'right room' and had to stand in line at desk to do so (1/2 hour wait) and they gave us another room as they had said they would.

Usually , in all the other hotels in Vegas they would upgrade or comp you something to try to make amends that first night- They didnt- and should have- moving rooms was a pain in the butt. I spoke with the front desk staff she was very "" I could give a rats ass if you stay here or not' and when I spoke with the manager on duty-even she didnt seem to care if I was unhappy or not.That fake smile was so annoying.

Its not like the entire hotel was full- it was New years Day-everyone was checking OUT. 

Take note TI from Caesars,NYNY, and even CircusCircus - who have all done that ! Ive been to Las Vegas at least 10 times...Really TI?

Room was pretty standard-nothing spectacular- but bathroom and tub were nice size.
Halls were really quiet and room was on 22nd floor with decent view.

The entrance where the check in is could use some updating- the colors are old and seventies and still a bit of that 'Pirate' flair which they look like they are moving away from.(and should - its not a daycare - its a hotel)",5,BHhwoal42ansQj6K78hytg

While my wife and I were unimpressed by Jeffrey's Grocery in NYC, we absolutely loved Merchant. The food, atmosphere and craft bar would put Merchant among the top ""casual"" fine dining places in NYC.... and this place is in Madison.  

Here is a New York City description of Merchant.  Put the Spotted Pig together with Le Pain Quotidien, Wichcraft and Employees Only craft bar and you would have something like Merchant.

We went for lunch and had the cured pork with fresh mozzerella and pickled onions. For dinner we had the roast chicken and trout.  The food was outrageously good.  

The only question I have is when Merchant will expand to NYC.

I've seen Afrojack and Deadmau5 spin at EBC and it's always been a good time. They get the best EDM DJ's in the world here(just like Marquee Day Club), so if you like pool parties and EDM this is the place to be. They have DJ's such as Tiesto, Avicii, Deadmau5, Afrojack, Steve Angello, Calvin Harris, Deniz Koyu...

Entry:
I can't stress this enough: Buy presale tickets online! If you know you are going to go beforehand, just do it. It'll save you lots of $$, about 50% off what you would pay at the door. You'll save lots of time waiting in line as well. The one time we didn't buy online presale tix, we had to wait in a super long line to get in the day of and it took forever. After waiting for over an hour and not moving very much we decided to do what you always do if you don't want to wait: Grease the bouncers. So we greased him a Benjamin and we finally got to the front where we then had to pay the full price which was something like $125 each. Ridiculous! If we had bought our tix online it would have been like $60. You can bring in a backpack but you can't bring in any outside food or drink and they inspect it very thoroughly. You cannot bring in eye drops or any medication. You will need to check it in at the front and then go back to get it if you need it. 

Environment:
Unlike Marquee Day Club, there is plenty of space to find an area to sit either on the edge of the pool or on the side by one of the planters. The capacity of EBC is probably 3 times the size of Marquee Day Club, so it seems much more relaxed. Be warned, the music is very loud because they have speakers surrounding the entire pool which is actually quite impressive. I think I counted something like 80 speakers surrounding the pool all along the walls. Because of this there isn't really any place you can go where the music is not loud, so if you need a break from the noise you'll need to leave the pool or bring ear plugs. Since the pool is so large, you can easily find a place to take a quick dip on either side or in the middle in front of the DJ.  There is an area to dance in front of the DJ as well. 

Food/Drink:
Drinks are ridiculously expensive which is expected at any Vegas club, almost $20 per drink after tax and tip. However food is actually pretty good here, and costs much less than alcohol! The chicken sandwich/wrap is what I order every single time. They also sell soda, powerade, water, and beer at the food window. The line usually moves much faster than the line at the bar, so if you just want a beer or soda or water, this is a good place to go. 

One complaint about this place... the security is not very good, but as expected they probably are just temporary workers, not permanent. One time I was drinking my powerade and a head of security lady came up to me and told me I wasn't allowed to bring in outside food or drink and told me to throw it away. As you can imagine I was very confused since I had paid like $5 for it at the food window! So I argue with her for a little while and she still doesn't believe me so then my friends have to come and back me up and tell her that I really bought it at the food window, along with beer, water etc. Obviously she did not know what drinks they actually sold at the food window so she finally gave up and believed us. 

EBC sets the standard for how all other pool parties in Vegas should be, which is why I gave it 5 stars. People who give it four stars are just complaining about the service or price of drinks, but wtf do they expect? And where else is there a better pool party in Vegas? Marquee is the only other pool party that compares because they get all the popular DJ's too, and all the really hot model girls go there. But Marquee is way smaller, super cramped and crowded and the drinks cost just as much.",4,qhqYQ0vbhjBFZN4fU93M9Q

Seating in the booths was very uncomfortable. So if there is an other option, I suggest you choose a table. Booths have very hard wooden seats with semi soft backing that was also WAY too far away from the table. Awkward seating situation that made us squirm through the meal.

I had to go to our hotel's front deck and beg the clerk for a couple of plastic forks. 

The burrito was huge and very tasty. I had a couple of Grilled Chicken mini-tacos, and while they were pretty good, they were nothing special and I even found a few pieces of gristle. My wife had a chicken burrito and said it was huge and very good. She could not finish it. They also gave us some hot carrots so that scored well with her.

Ten bucks for all of that, including four salsas and sour cream. Not bad, but I'd like to try more.",1,JCXisllEP6_d1dB2QYw8wA

To keep this short, M&T had blocked two of my friends due to the ""sporty"" nature of their loafers (remember, this is Charlotte, the cultural hotbed of the southeast). They were enforcing a dress code expecting 100% of their patrons to be dressed in cocktail attire, as this is what the normal Charlottean looks like on a Thursday night. 

Once we made it past the bouncers, the bar itself was underwhelming, close to empty, and took forever to make overpriced drinks and undercooked food.

I've been using Progressive for a few months now and have been pleased with the service, but recently moved to a different town with my partner (also from the same town) and was pleased to find that they reduced her monthly insurance rate by nearly a hundred dollars because they were claiming that the town we were moving to was a safer place. Within a couple days I was notified of a change in my insurance payment as well but was surprised to find that it was nearly a hundred dollars HIGHER than it usually is. I call customer service and after being transferred around between a few people who had no clue what they were doing I was linked up with a gentleman who informed me that I now have an increased payment do to the ZIP code that I now reside in being more dangerous and high risk (opposite of the reason my girlfriend's payment was dropped). Not to mention a couple of months ago we both got a letter of non-renewal form the company only to find out upon calling that it was yet another mistake from their end that led them to think that I had moved to Texas, yet when I looked outside it seemed to me that I was still in Oregon...............

Long story short, I thought that I had found a good company to have insurance coverage with at last, but it turns out that Progressive is just as willing to lie and twist the reality that is insurance liability and risk to whatever form best fits THEIR needs.

I've already canceled my policy and as someone who is in the automotive industry I have no problem steering the customers in need that I meet away from Progressive when they ask for my recommendation.",1,ilz23m0VJi4atFK0VwbMGw

There are multiple food ""stands"" here, and you eat in a small area that is shared with others.  Not a big deal to me, but don't expect BWW or other establishment.  It is a cool idea though, more for college kids I think, since it is right near CSN.  

Ordered the fried pickles, jalapeno bombers, and traditional wings of course.

Pickles were good...it is the sauce that makes them actually.  The pickles by themselves didn't do much for me, but the cajun/mayo/ranch whatever it was is pretty solid and goes well with the vinegary/saltiness.  Jalapeno bombers were not very good....pretty bland...would not recommend.

As for the wings, I saw them cook the entire batch at one time.  But somehow, some of them got overcooked and dry, others were absolutely perfect.  There were some with a lot of blood vessels or whatever it is called, and one of mine had a broken bone with marrow all around the insides and chunks of bone pieces...yuck.  These must be frozen and transported via UPS freight (jk...kind of)....

Tried the parm garlic, mango habenero (I think), and carribean jerk bbq.  The garlic parm was ok...the habenero was like a basic hot to me...both were good, but not great.  What WAS great was their carribean jerk.  It was an excellent, spicy mixture of bbq and jerk'ness and really really wish all the others had that much thought and love put into them.

Since all the other reviews seemed great, I must have had a bad experience or bad choices in sauce at least.  If the wings were cooked right, it would have made this a 4 star, and more than one solid choice in flavor, would have bumped another outta me.  I guess I will stick with the chain restaurants for solid and consistent wings.",0,eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A
